Just days after taking Bryson DeChambeau to the final hole at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, the Englishman added a 66 to his first-round 69 and leads by one shot from Matthew Fitzpatrick at the Players Championship. McIlroy has admitted a desire to add more length to his game, fuelled in part by DeChambeau\u2019s power play at the 2020 US Open, has triggered technical problems that were visible here. A second round of 75 at Sawgrass, added to Thursday\u2019s 79, meant McIlroy comfortably missed the cut. Afterwards, he expanded on the basis for his swing issues. \u201cProbably, like October last year, doing a little bit of speed training, started getting sucked into that stuff, swing got flat, long and too rotational,\u201d said McIlroy. \u201cObviously I added some speed and am hitting the ball longer but what that did to my swing as a whole probably wasn\u2019t a good thing. So I\u2019m sort of fighting to get back out of that. That\u2019s what I\u2019m frustrated with.\u201d When asked why he had embarked on such a journey, McIlroy\u2019s answer raised eyebrows. \u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said it wasn\u2019t anything to do with what Bryson did at the US Open,\u201d said the four-times major winner. \u201cI think a lot of people saw that and were like, \u2018Whoa, if this is the way they\u2019re going to set golf courses up in the future, it helps. It really helps.\u2019 \u201cThe one thing that people don\u2019t appreciate is how good Bryson is out of the rough. Not only because of how upright he is but because his short irons are longer than standard, so he can get a little more speed through the rough than us, than other guys. I thought being able to get some more speed is a good thing and maybe just to the detriment a little bit of my swing, I got there. I just need to maybe rein it back in a little bit.\u201d     As McIlroy headed home, Westwood, at nine under par, has aspirations of claiming the Players just a month before his 48th birthday. \u201cI care less about the outcomes now,\u201d said Westwood. \u201cI still care about my performance and that in turn leads me to work as hard as I\u2019ve always worked. But I\u2019ve been working with a psychologist for a few years now and we just focus on the process, we don\u2019t focus on the outcomes and things we can\u2019t control.\u201d Fitzpatrick, who has made back-to-back 68s.

The leaders during the meeting agreed to pool financing, manufacturing and distribution capacity to send 1 billion coronavirus vaccines to Asian and Pacific island countries by the end of 2022. In a joint statement released after the first meeting, the four leaders called for a \u201ctransparent and results-oriented reform\u201d of the World Health Organization and said they would work to strengthen climate actions of all nations.    Some analysts have described the first Quad leaders\u2019 meeting as \u201ca historic step\u201d that signals \u201ca new level of political determination to balance together against Chinese power\u201d among the US, Australia, India and Japan. Prof Rory Medcalf, head of the national security college at the Australian National University, said the meeting showed the importance Biden\u2019s administration was putting on the region. He said Biden had \u201creshaped\u201d the Quad to be a more constructive and positive force that was open to co-operation, which was a significant shift from a Trump-era approach that was more confrontational. He said the Biden administration was instead opening the door for China to engage and co-operate with the Quad countries, while still allowing competition. \u201cAmerica wants to compete with China and win the hearts and minds of the rest of Asia, rather than take a zero-sum approach.\u201d Medcalf said the Quad would also give the US an opportunity to further push Australia to increase its climate ambition. Biden sent a signal on the priority he placed on climate by inviting his special envoy, John Kerry, to be part of his delegation, which also included the vice-president, Kamala Harris, and the secretary of state, Antony Blinken. Last month Kerry publicly acknowledged past \u201cdifferences\u201d between the US and Australia in tackling the climate crisis while calling for a faster exit from coal-fired power around the globe. Among the Quad grouping, the US and Japan have already committed to net-zero emissions by 2050, while Australia has expressed a preference to achieve the goal without making a firm pledge amid pushback from the Nationals. India also has not committed to net zero by 2050 but has promised to exceed expectations.

The council emerged from closed session to announce the move, which includes $500,000 for the neighborhood where Floyd was arrested. \n \n  Related: Derek Chauvin trial: judge grants request to add third-degree murder charge  \n \nThe Floyd family attorney, Ben Crump, said in a prepared statement that it was the largest pre-trial civil rights settlement ever in a wrongful death lawsuit, and \u201csends a powerful message that Black lives do matter and police brutality against people of color must end\u201d. \nFloyd, who was Black, was declared dead on 25 May 2020 after Derek Chauvin, a former police officer who is white, pressed his knee against his neck for almost nine minutes. Floyd\u2019s death sparked mass protests in Minneapolis and across the US and led to a national reckoning on racial justice. \n\u201cI hope that today will center the voices of the family and anything that they would like to share,\u201d the council president, Lisa Bender, said. \u201cBut I do want to, on behalf of the entire city council, offer my deepest condolences to the family of George Floyd, his friends and all of our community who are mourning his loss.\u201d \nFloyd\u2019s sister, Bridgett Floyd, said in a statement: \u201cOn behalf of all of my family members, I am pleased that this part of our tragic journey to justice for my brother George is resolved.\u201d \nShe added: \u201cOur family suffered an irreplaceable loss May 25 when George\u2019s life was senselessly taken by a Minneapolis police officer. While we will never get our beloved George back, we will continue to work tirelessly to make this world a better, and safer, place for all.\u201d \nFloyd\u2019s family filed the federal civil rights lawsuit in July against the city, Chauvin and three other fired officers charged in his death. It alleged the officers violated Floyd\u2019s rights when they restrained him, and that the city allowed a culture of excessive force, racism and impunity to flourish in its police force. \n \n  Related: Minneapolis on trial: how the year of George Floyd changed me and my city  \n \nGeorge Floyd\u2019s brother, Philonise Floyd, said of the settlement: \u201cEven though my brother is not here, he\u2019s here with me in my heart. If I could get him back, I would give all this back.\u201d \n\u201cThat dollar amount shows that what happened to George Floyd was wrong. It goes to show that we matter but it\u2019s an opportunity to show that these types of injustices are wrong. It was a clear violation of George Floyd\u2019s civil rights. It shouldn\u2019t have happened,\u201d said Todd Gramenz of Black Lives Matter St Paul. \nBlack Lives Matter Saint Paul was established in 2014 after Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson. They have been organizing protests and lobbying since then. \nGramenz added that you cannot really put a dollar value on a life. \u201cHow do you value a Black man, who\u2019s innocent, that\u2019s killed?\u201d he said, and called for more police who kill to stand trial. \nOnly one Minnesota police officer has been convicted a murder before, a Black officer who killed a white women, yet several hundred Minnesotans have suffered police-involved deaths in the last 20 years. \nIt was not immediately clear how the settlement might affect the trial or the jury now being seated to hear it. Joseph Daly, a professor emeritus at Mitchell Hamline School of Law, said it will be hard to stop jurors or potential jurors from hearing about it. \n\u201cJudge Cahill will likely explain to the jurors that each must make a decision based solely on the evidence they hear in the criminal trial,\u201d Daly said. \nAny praise for the settlement overlooks \u201chow many families that have failed to get a settlement and how they have failed to hold police accountable\u201d, DJ Hooker from the Twin Cities Coalition for Justice 4 Jamar campaign group told the Guardian. \nHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s good that we see that this happened with the $27m but on top of that, we need to make sure that happens for all families affected by police brutality. Everyone doesn\u2019t get the same amount. It\u2019s not fair. Everyone needs to be able to get money when their loved ones die.\u201d \nHowever, Hooker said holding police officers accountable and protecting the community by preventing brutality and violence was vital. \nL Chris Stewart, an attorney who worked with Floyd\u2019s family, said the size of the settlement \u201cchanges evaluations and civil rights for a Black person when they die\u201d. \n\u201cAnd what happens is that trickles down to decisions in the communities across this country.

The New York governor had earlier again refused to resign after a group of New York\u2019s most powerful and prominent Democrats in the House of Representatives joined calls for him to step down over multiple sexual misconduct allegations, and scrutiny over his administration\u2019s misreporting of Covid-19 deaths among nursing home residents. Schumer and Gillibrand put out a joint statement, saying: \u201cConfronting and overcoming the Covid crisis requires sure and steady leadership. We commend the brave actions of the individuals who have come forward with serious allegations of abuse and misconduct.\u201d It continued: \u201cDue to the multiple, credible sexual harassment and misconduct allegations, it is clear that Governor Cuomo has lost the confidence of his governing partners and the people of New York. Governor Cuomo should resign.\u201d At a press conference earlier on Friday, Cuomo denied all of the sexual misconduct allegations and castigated politicians calling for him to quit as \u201creckless and dangerous\u201d and engaging in \u201ccancel culture\u201d. \u201cI did not do what has been alleged. Period,\u201d Cuomo said. The governor said he wanted investigations into the allegations to proceed but added: \u201cI\u2019m not going to resign. Period. \u201cPoliticians who don\u2019t know a single fact but yet form a conclusion and an opinion are, in my opinion, reckless and dangerous,\u201d he added. His statement came shortly after a group of congressional representatives including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a standard bearer for the party\u2019s progressive wing, as well as Jerry Nadler, who chairs the House judiciary committee, and Carolyn Maloney, the chair of the House oversight committee. Nadler said on Friday that Cuomo had lost the confidence of New Yorkers. \u201cThe repeated accusations against the governor, and the manner in which he has responded to them, have made it impossible for him to continue to govern at this point,\u201d the congressman said. In a joint statement issued with Jamaal Bowman, another New York congressman, Ocasio-Cortez said the latest allegation of sexual harassment against Cuomo was \u201calarming\u201d and \u201craises concerns about the present safety and well-being of the administration\u2019s staff. These allegations have all been consistent and highly detailed, and there are also credible media reports substantiating their accounts\u201d. The duo added that the six accusations of sexual harassment and misconduct leveled at Cuomo came on top of claims that the governor\u2019s administration hid data on Covid-19 deaths in nursing homes, a combination that means that Cuomo \u201ccan no longer effectively lead in the face of so many challenges\u201d.    In total, 10 of the 19 Democrats from New York elected to the House of Representatives have now called for Cuomo\u2019s resignation, with Kathleen Rice, who represents a section of New York\u2019s Long Island, previously calling for his removal. On Thursday, Bill de Blasio, mayor of New York City and a longtime Cuomo rival, also urged the governor to step down, alongside 59 New York state lawmakers, meaning that almost all major New York Democratshave now turned on the state\u2019s chief executive. The New York state assembly also launched an \u201cimpeachment investigation\u201d into the sexual misconduct allegations made by the six women. A separate investigation is being led by the state attorney general, Letitia James. \u201cThe reports of accusations concerning the governor are serious,\u201d said Carl Heastie, the speaker of the state assembly. The assembly judiciary committee will oversee the investigation, which will have the power to interview witnesses and subpoena documents. Forty-seven state senators have already said Cuomo should step down, more than the 46 needed to convict the governor if he was impeached. Separately, police in Albany said that they have been notified of the allegations and that these \u201cmay have risen to the level of a crime\u201d although this does not mean they have opened a criminal investigation. Cuomo had previously denied any wrongdoing in his treatment of women, although he has provided a general apology if any of his previous actions made anyone feel uncomfortable. On Friday, Cuomo, who was attorney general of New York and Bill Clinton\u2019s housing secretary and is the son of the late governor Mario Cuomo, said: \u201cI am not part of the political club.\u201d He said it wasn\u2019t clear why all the sexual misconduct allegations had been made now. He said they should be taken very seriously, but he denied any inappropriate conduct. \u201cLook, it\u2019s very simple: I never harassed someone. I\u2019ve never abused anyone,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cYou need to know the facts before you make a decision,\u201d he said, referring to his critics. \u201cPeople know the difference between playing politics, bowing to cancel culture and the truth.\u201d On the nursing home deaths, the governor has previously claimed his administration had to verify deaths of residents at hospitals, but critics questioned why that hadn\u2019t held up the release of data in other states. Cuomo\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Along with an allegation that the governor groped a female aide at the Executive Mansion last year, Cuomo is facing allegations of sexually suggestive remarks and behavior toward women, including female aides. One aide said he asked her if she would ever have sex with an older man. And another aide claimed Cuomo once kissed her without consent, and said the governor\u2019s aides publicly smeared her after she accused him of sexual harassment. The White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, has repeatedly said that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris both support the attorney general\u2019s investigation into the harassment allegations.

The broadcasters told their listeners on the NFHS Network stream they would return after a break and then one, apparently not realizing the audio was still live, used an expletive and the epithet as the Norman players knelt. \u201cThey\u2019re kneeling?

Rowan, who described himself as a family man and former youth pastor, said there was \u201cno excuse\u201d for his comments before disclosing that he suffers from type 1 diabetes and attributing his use of racist language to hyperglycemia. \u201cI do not believe I would have made such horrible statements absent my sugar spiking,\u201d the statement read.

Joelinton sets off up the field and is fouled by Mings. The Newcastle striker stays on his feet and continues on his way, only to be fouled by Mings again.

Emi Martinez spares his blushes with a save that was perhaps a little more acrobatic than necessary.

His shot hits Willocks legs, then one of Mings\u2019s feet and loops over the cross bar.    52 min: The ball\u2019s curled toward the far post by Targett and Konsa wins the header under pressure from several Newcastle defenders. His effort floats across the face of goal and wide.    52 min: Emile Krafth is booked for a tackle on Ollie Watkins as the Villa striker threatened to escape his clutches and bear down on goal.

Momentarily, it looks as if he might have rolled the ball into his own net but there wasn\u2019t enough pace on it to trundle over the line.

Oh, to have a Jack Grealish and/or a Miguel Almiron on the pitch - this is mindnumbing.    32 min: Jonjo Shelvey plays a long ball towards Dwight Gayle in the Newcastle penalty area. Ezri Konsa outjumps him and heads clear.    31 min: From the free-kick, Fraser crosses the ball into the etc, and so on. Villa clear again.

The delivery is deep and lands at the feet of Trezeguet on the right side of the box. His cross for Douglas Luiz at the far post is overhit. Goal-kick.    24 min: There\u2019s very little in the way of quality on show tonight, with both teams struggling to muster anything in the way of a serious threat on goal.    21 min: Yep, Traore is off and is replaced by Anwar El Ghazi.    20 min: Traore is back on his feet but looks like he might have busted a rib. He\u2019s holding the left side of his rib-cage and grimacing with pain. I think he\u2019s done for the night. Updated at 8.38pm GMT    19 min: Playing with numerical advantage, Newcastle apply some pressure. Joelinton has a shot blocked, then an inviting cross towards the far post is cleared.    16 min: In a foot-race with Paul Dummett to prevent the ball going out of play down by the byline, Bertrand Traore is forced to hurdle an advertising hoarding behind the goal, only to clatter into another one a few feet behind it. He goes to ground and looks in a bit of trouble - that hurt. Play resumes while he receives treatment, which seems rather unfair on Villa.   Updated at 8.24pm GMT    14 min: A long ball to Joelinton out by the right touchline and he uses his strength to get past Tyrone Mings and head on a diagonal run towards goal. With only Martinez to beat, he looks to have a clear shot on goal until Ezri Konsa appears out of nowhere to block with a heroic last-ditch tackle. That is brilliant.

Nothing comes of it and Newcastle clear. Ten minutes in and there\u2019s not much between the sides, but Villa are looking the more menacing.    8 min: Ahmed Elmohamady curls a nice cross into the Newcastle penalty area, trying to pick out Ollie Watkins. Jamaal Lascelles makes a vital headed interception.    6 min: Villa go on the attack, after Ezri Konsa lumps the ball long out of defence. Nothing comes of it and the ball soon ends up back at the feet of their goalkeeper.    4 min: The first shot in anger comes from Ryan Fraser, who fires straight at Emi Martinez from distance after good work from Gayle and Joelinton.    4 min: The ball\u2019s curled into the penalty area and Ezri Konsa almost gets his head to it. The ball breaks to McGinn, who curls an effort from outside the penalty area high and wide of Martin Dubravka\u2019s goal.    3 min: Jonjo Shelvey brings down Jacob Ramsey to concede a free-kick wide on the left, halfway inside the Newcastle half.    2 min: Under pressure from Ryan Fraser, who has lined up behind Joelinton and Dwight Gayle, Emi Martinez boots the ball out for a throw-in near the halfway line.    1 min: Newcastle win an early throw-in deep in Villa territory, which Emile Krafth chucks long. Villa clear. Newcastle v Aston Villa is go ...     Not long now: Villa are first out on to the pitch, followed by their hosts. Both sets of players line up either side of the team of match officials and kick-off is just a few minutes away.

To its credit, the film, from The Blind Side writer-director John Lee Hancock, does find itself in slightly unconventional territory in its rushed finale but it\u2019s not a place that\u2019s either satisfying or smart enough to warrant the hushed solemnity that precedes it. It\u2019s a film trapped between a low- and a highbrow version of a story we know all too well, landing firmly in the middle of the road.   Related: Palmer review \u2013 Justin Timberlake aims for redemption in familiar drama   Maybe if Hancock\u2019s film had been produced back in the early 90s, it would have at least felt like a more admirably serious-minded riposte to a sub-genre that often devolves into silliness. But at a time when even small-screen procedurals have perma-frowned detectives who spend more time haunted by their past than actually solving crimes in the present, it all feels a little too familiar and a little too minor. As a slow, meditative character-driven drama, it\u2019s too shallow and as a dark, disturbing serial killer thriller, it\u2019s too boring and so quite who this film is for remains a bigger mystery than the one at its centre. As probably the most reliable leading man currently working in Hollywood, Washington can put a shine on even the dullest of material and while he\u2019s no doubt stretched here, he avoids a mere sleepwalk and singlehandedly helps muster up just enough interest to drag us through. His character is mostly standard issue, but it\u2019s a sturdy, accomplished turn, the kind that only he can do quite this well, yet his other two Oscar-winning co-stars struggle. Playing a dogged LAPD detective with the same otherworldly strangeness that won him plaudits for Mr Robot and Bohemian Rhapsody (and makes him a perfect choice for a Bond villain), Malek is awkwardly ill-suited for the role, a performance so discordant, it makes one question the actor\u2019s long-term versatility and just how Hollywood will best make use of him. While Leto certainly looks the part of \u201cpotential killer of women\u201d with his pale sunken skin and greasy long hair, his line delivery is so embarrassingly unsubtle that he might as well have walked off the set of a Hammer horror parody, never convincing us that he\u2019s playing anything other than an Evil Movie Villain. That juicy killer-cop interplay, the spiky cat and mouse game that drives films such as this, just isn\u2019t really there, Hancock struggling to differentiate his film from the many others that have come before, as admirably hard as Washington tries. That aforementioned ending, while theoretically interesting, just doesn\u2019t land with the impact Hancock seems to think it does, a big swing that misses. Part of me admires him for it, but it\u2019s such an empty coda presented with such weight, urging us to take what\u2019s mostly a rather rote serial killer movie with awards-worthy seriousness, that it ultimately annoys (what it says about cops is also rather uneasy at this, or frankly any, moment).

Pak Ho had been taking his early morning walk on Tuesday, authorities said, when a man approached him to forcibly rob him. In the course of the robbery, the man allegedly punched Ho, causing him to fall to the ground, hit his head and suffer a traumatic brain injury.  Police on Thursday arrested Teaunte Bailey, 26, in connection with the robbery. Police said that through their investigation, they \u201clearned that the suspect has a history of victimizing elderly Asian people\u201d. In addition to Ho\u2019s death, prosecutors also charged Bailey with the robbery and assault of a 72-year-old Asian man at an Oakland senior care home in February. Authorities said Bailey allegedly broke into the senior living apartment, and shoved the victim while saying \u201cmoney, money\u201d at him, before leaving with the victim\u2019s phone and numerous other items from the home.    \u201cI\u2019m at a loss for words,\u201d said LeRonne Armstrong, Oakland police chief, in a statement. \u201cOur elders should be protected, not the victim of a deadly assault.\u201d Bailey\u2019s arrest comes amid reports of anti-Asian violence, particularly against Asian elders, across the country. Earlier this year, an 84-year-old Thai man, Vicha Ratanapakdee, was killed in a seemingly unprovoked attack in San Francisco. Anti-Asian sentiments, fueled for years by the Trump administration\u2019s trade war with China, exploded with the pandemic and Donald Trump\u2019s bigoted usage of \u201cChina virus\u201d and \u201ckung flu\u201d. Advocates and community organizers have called for action and more awareness of anti-Asian hate, as well as unity between different communities in the face of racial divisions. Oakland\u2019s Chinatown, in particular, has experienced a spate of robberies and assaults in the past few weeks, including an incident in which a man shoved three individuals to the sidewalk. \u201cIt\u2019s just been one after the other,\u201d said Carl Chan, president of Oakland\u2019s Chinatown chamber of commerce, to the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s been so difficult.\u201d Chan said the Bay Area\u2019s Asian community feels unheard and unprotected, frequently complaining about the same individuals coming back into their neighborhoods to rob their stores and victimize their elders. Yet they still keep returning, and their community members keep getting hurt, Chan said. Chan is frustrated. To the community, these attacks feel like hate crimes, Chan said, even though authorities haven\u2019t qualified any of the assaults as such \u2013 by definition, a hate crime is a crime motivated by prejudice of a certain group, and he wonders how someone could repeatedly target one community if that person was not fueled by hatred of that community. \u201cAll the crimes being committed by the same suspect, coming back over and over and over again, how can we not believe that is a hate crime?\u201d he asked. Chan spoke briefly with Ho\u2019s three daughters, whom he described as heartbroken and hurt over their father\u2019s death. He said they were now especially concerned about the safety of community elders. \u201cPeople are facing one pandemic, we are facing two, and this is probably worse,\u201d Chan said. \u201cWe can take a vaccine.

A number of representatives of the No Beijing 2022 campaign said on Friday that they had met the IOC last October to give detailed insight into the abuses being faced by Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang province, as well as in Hong Kong and Tibet, and urge them to move the Games \u2013 but left feeling the IOC had \u201ccompletely dismissed our experiences and sufferings\u201d. More than one million Uighurs are believed to be in re-education camps, and on Thursday the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, confirmed that \u201cthe genocide against Uighur Muslims\u201d is something that would be a topic of discussion when US officials meet China directly next week. There have been growing calls for a boycott of Beijing 2022 because of the human rights abuses. But Zumretay Arkin, the program and advocacy manager at the World Uyghur Congress, said the IOC had dismissed her concerns.    \u201cWhen we met with the IOC in October, we asked them to listen to our voices but instead they completely dismissed our experiences and sufferings,\u201d she said. \u201cThey conveniently hedge behind political neutrality when it comes to China. \u201cThey also repeatedly told us that the IOC\u2019s mission was to create a better world \u2013 a world with absolutely no discrimination based on race, religion, gender, sexual orientation,\u201d she added. \u201cA better world to us means a free and democratic world where there are no camps, no forced labour, no cultural and religious repression, no arbitrary arrest, no police brutality. A better world is a world without genocide. \u201cOur question was simple, does the IOC accept hosting the Olympic Games in a country that is actively committing a genocide? The answer we received was also very simple. Yes, the IOC is willing to host genocidal Olympic Games.\u201d Frances Hui, a Hong Kong activist in exile, said she had a similar experience when meeting the IOC. \u201cI talked about the fact that more than 10,000 protesters in Hong Kong were arrested in just a year, and the fact that China is violating international human rights obligations. And the first thing we heard from the IOC is: \u2018It is a very complicated world.\u2019 \u201cAnd I asked again: \u2018How are you going to legitimise a Games in a country practising genocide and murder?\u2019 and the IOC again replied to me: \u2018It\u2019s a complex world.\u2019 \u201cIronically, that is the same kind of rhetoric that people from China always tell me when I bring up the fact that two million Uighur workers are in camps,\u201d she added. \u201cWhen I talk about Tibetans as having their lands occupied by China, all they say is: \u2018It\u2019s complicated.\u2019 But no, it\u2019s not complicated.\u201d However, the IOC president, Thomas Bach, insisted one of the key principles of the Olympic charter is political neutrality \u2013 adding that the IOC is not equipped to solve all the world\u2019s problems. \u201cWe are taking this very seriously,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we are not a super world government where the IOC can solve or even address issues for which the UN security council, G7 and G20 has no solution. \u201cWe have to fulfil our role and to live up to our responsibilities within our area of responsibilities, and the governments have to live up to their responsibilities in their remits. \u201cHuman rights and labour rights and others will be part of the host city contract. And on this, we are working very closely with the organising committee that we are also monitoring. This includes, for instance, supply chains or labour rights, and their freedom of press and many other issues.\u201d Bach said a boycott of the Winter Olympics over China\u2019s human rights abuses would not work. \u201cWe can only repeat and give advice to learn from history \u2013 a boycott of the Olympic Games has never achieved anything,\u201d he said. \u201cBe mindful of the boycott in Moscow in 1980 because of the intervention of the Soviet army in Afghanistan. The Soviet army withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989 \u2013 nine years after. \u201cSo it really served nothing but punishing the athletes and then led to the counter-boycott in Los Angeles. It also has no logic, why would you punish the athletes from your own country if you have a dispute with athletes from another country? This just makes no real sense.

Newcastle United\u2019s captain most definitely subscribes to the view that when the going gets tough, the tough get going and, deep in stoppage time, he re-emphasised his importance to Steve Bruce\u2019s side. Minutes earlier Ciaran Clark had scored a freakish own goal which threatened to be calamitous in Newcastle\u2019s struggle to avoid relegation but, by meeting Jacob Murphy\u2019s left-wing cross and powering a bullet header beyond Emiliano Mart\u00ednez, Lascelles salvaged a potentially vital point. It is no exaggeration to say that equaliser might well have saved Bruce from the sack but his, and his side\u2019s position, remain precarious. They stand 16th, only two points ahead of both 18th placed Fulham \u2013 who play Manchester City on Saturday \u2013 and 17th placed Brighton \u2013 who face Southampton on Sunday before hosting Newcastle next weekend.    Outwardly at least, Bruce remains upbeat. \u201cIt was a hideous goal to concede, a bit of a fluke but we showed the desire to get back into the game,\u201d said the former Villa manager. \u201cThere\u2019s still 10 games to go and I\u2019m convinced we\u2019ll be okay. There\u2019s no question managing Newcastle is difficult. There\u2019s a huge spotlight - but that\u2019s the way it should be and I\u2019m ready for the challenge.\u201d St James\u2019 Park may have been virtually empty but the handful congregated inside clapped as loudly as possible during a heartfelt pre-kick-off minute\u2019s applause for Glenn Roeder, who died two weeks ago. Had the ground been full it would undoubtedly have been an emotional occasion as fans paid tribute to a much loved former captain and manager but it is now more than a year since the turnstiles last closed here. The absence of supporters has arguably kept Bruce in a job and home season ticket holders would doubtless have been unimpressed as Villa began in determinedly zealous mode, winning virtually every second ball. Nonetheless Joelinton really should have scored in the 14th minute after connecting with Jonjo Shelvey\u2019s through pass and sidestepping Tyrone Mings. The \u00a340m Brazilian was left with only Mart\u00ednez to beat but hesitated at the vital moment, taking one touch too many and permitting Ezri Konsa to make an intelligently timed interception. Both sides were without injured attacking catalysts \u2013 Jack Grealish in Villa\u2019s case and Callum Wilson, Allan Saint-Maximin and Miguel Almir\u00f3n in Newcastle\u2019s \u2013 and their absence explained the under-employment of both goalkeepers. Although Martin Dubravka expertly parried Trezeguet\u2019s angled shot after the forward dribbled past Paul Dummett, Newcastle\u2019s keeper was generally well protected by a highly efficient defence. Bruce\u2019s problems lay further forward, specifically in an attacking department where Joelinton\u2019s industry could not camouflage the general shortage of improvisation and incision. If the effort and sometimes almost painful endeavour on view was creditable, the lack of elan suggested Villa may have hit a ceiling in their clamber up the table. Admittedly a Konsa header flashed across the face of goal and Clark did extremely well to block Bertrand Traor\u00e9\u2019s fierce shot but Matt Targett was slightly fortunate not to head an own goal after Joelinton\u2019s cross caught him unawares. Meanwhile Mart\u00ednez looked mightily relieved to see Murphy\u2019s shot rebound off the bar. \u201cThat was the best opportunity of the night,\u201d said Bruce. According to the so-called immutable law of the ex it is not uncommon for footballers to score against their old clubs but when Ollie Watkins\u2019s header took a hefty deflection off Clark, the former Villa defender appeared to have registered the winner for his old employers. Clark and Lascelles are close pals and the latter delighted in easing his friend\u2019s misery by heading arguably the most important goal of his career. It left Dean Smith sanguine. \u201cWe didn\u2019t deserve to win,\u201d said Villa\u2019s manager. \u201cIt was a very scrappy game, we have a few players short on confidence and we\u2019re not creating chances.\u201d", "Author": "Louise Taylor at St James' Park", "article_body_bow": [[1, 0.2241073092], [4, 0.1765653954], [5, 0.1120536546], [10, 0.1553778205], [12, 0.2241073092], [14, 0.1746255632], [16, 0.1215422515], [19, 0.1430384396], [23, 0.1765653954], [24, 0.338181861], [32, 0.1845224085], [36, 0.338181861], [39, 0.1620438175], [41, 0.1620438175], [42, 0.1845224085], [44, 0.1553778205], [46, 0.1690909305], [47, 0.5535672256], [48, 0.1620438175]]}, {"Source": "The Guardian", "Date": "2021-03-12", "Title": "Premier League hurtling towards \u00a32bn black hole, warns Richard Masters", "Article": "Richard Masters, the chief executive of the Premier League, has admitted the current season has proved \u201cbrutal\u201d for top-flight clubs and warned of a financial loss heading \u201ctowards \u00a32bn\u201d.

Vance made the announcement in a memo to staffers, ending months of speculation about his future and signaling it is likely to be a brand-new DA who sees the Trump case through, although Vance could still make a decision about charges before his term expires at the end of the year.    Vance, a Democrat, counted the fallen movie mogul Harvey Weinstein\u2019s rape conviction a year ago among his crowning achievements. But he has faced withering criticism over other high-profile cases, including dropping rape charges against the former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn in 2011 and declining to prosecute Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr over fraud allegations in 2012. \u201cI never imagined myself as district attorney for decades like my predecessors. I never thought of this as my last job, even though it\u2019s the best job and biggest honor I\u2019ll ever have,\u201d Vance, 66, said on Friday.  His decision not to seek re-election was widely expected, but he held off on making it official while the US supreme court weighed whether his office could obtain Trump\u2019s tax records. The court ruled in Vance\u2019s favor last month. Some of the Democrats campaigning to replace Vance want to slash the office\u2019s budget, cut staff and skip prosecutions for a wider range of low-level offenses. Eight candidates are on the ballot for the party\u2019s June primary, an election likely to decide Vance\u2019s successor because Manhattan is so heavily Democratic. Vance ended most marijuana possession and subway turnstile jumping prosecutions, slashing the cases handled by his office by nearly 60%, to about 42,000 in 2019. He embraced diversionary programs for first-time offenders and established a unit to remedy wrongful convictions. The supreme court ruling on Trump\u2019s taxes was a capstone for Vance\u2019s tenure as district attorney, ending an 18-month fight with Trump\u2019s lawyers and bolstering a grand jury investigation that has drawn worldwide attention. Vance\u2019s investigation includes examining whether Trump or his businesses lied about the value of assets to gain favorable loan terms and tax benefits, and hush-money payments paid to women on Trump\u2019s behalf. It\u2019s one of the most high-profile prosecution jobs in the world, dramatized on TV\u2019s Law and Order and Blue Bloods. The district attorney oversees a staff of 500 lawyers and has a budget of about $125m. A separate forfeiture fund bankrolled by Wall Street settlements and worth more than $800m is used for grants to criminal justice and community organizations and big initiatives, such as testing backlogged rape kits. Vance, whose father was the former president Jimmy Carter\u2019s secretary of state, ran as a death penalty opponent and positioned himself as a criminal justice innovator, taking interest in national and global efforts to prevent cyber-attacks, gun violence and the theft of artwork and antiquities. After making a campaign pledge to re-examine the 1979 disappearance of six-year-old Etan Patz, a 2012 tip led to a new suspect and ultimately a conviction. Weinstein\u2019s conviction in a landmark #MeToo case last year boosted Vance\u2019s lagging legacy, giving him a career-defining win in a tenure clouded by concerns that he repeatedly gave powerful people special treatment. They included sidestepping an effort to pursue charges against Weinstein in 2015 and striking a deal in 2016 so well-connected gynecologist Robert Hadden could avoid prison for allegedly sexually abusing patients.

He will appear at Westminster magistrates court on Saturday for his first hearing, the start of the process that leads to a full trial for murder. \nIn a day of fast-moving developments, the Met announced that human remains found in woodland in Ashford, Kent, on Wednesday had been formally identified as the 33-year-old marketing executive. \nThe decision to charge Couzens, 48, was made by lawyers from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), which authorises criminal proceedings in England and Wales. \nRosemary Ainslie, head of special crime at the CPS, said: \u201cFollowing a referral of evidence by the Metropolitan police related to the death of Sarah Everard, the CPS has authorised the police to charge Wayne Couzens with murder and kidnapping. \n\u201cThe function of the CPS is not to decide whether a person is guilty of a criminal offence, but to make fair, independent and objective assessments about whether it is appropriate to present charges to a court to consider.\u201d  \nThe Met said that hundreds of its officers were working on the investigation, supported by colleagues from Kent police. \nCouzens was arrested at his home on Tuesday in Deal, Kent. He had previously worked at a garage run by his family in the county. \nAfter the announcement of the charging of one of their officers, the Met revealed that he had been with the force for just over two years, starting as a local officer before being transferred to the unit guarding embassies in the capital. \nIn a statement the Met said: \u201c[Couzens\u2019] first posting was to south area, where he joined a response team covering the Bromley area. He then moved to the parliamentary and diplomatic protection command on 1 February 2020, where his primary role was on uniformed patrol duties of diplomatic premises, mainly a range of embassies.\u201d \nEverard went missing after leaving a friend\u2019s house in Clapham, south London, at around 9pm. She is believed to have walked through Clapham Common on her way home to Brixton, a journey that should have taken around 50 minutes.  \nHer disappearance triggered a police investigation in which detectives scoured CCTV, video doorbell and bus camera footage for any clue as to what might have happened to her. Video taken from a doorbell camera captured Everard on the A205 Poynders Road walking towards Tulse Hill \u2013 the last known sighting of her alive.  \nSix days after she was last seen, the Met announced on 9 March that a serving officer had been arrested over her disappearance. Couzens was first arrested on suspicion of kidnap, and the next day arrested on suspicion of murder.  \nAlso arrested with Couzens on Tuesday at the same location was a woman aged in her 30s on suspicion of aiding an offender. She has been released on bail until mid-April. \nThe Met confirmed that for the second time since his arrest, Couzens had been found to have sustained a head injury in his cell at a London police station, which is covered by CCTV, and had been taken to a hospital for treatment. \nWith vigils protesting against violence against women planned for this weekend \u2013 which police are warning may breach lockdown rules \u2013 Met assistant commissioner Nick Ephgrave tried to heal any breach with sections of the community that the force serves, and said: \u201cI know that the public feel hurt and angry about what has happened and those are sentiments that I share personally and I know my colleagues here at Scotland Yard and across the Met share as well. \n\u201cI also recognise the wider concerns that are being raised quite rightly about the safety of women in public spaces in London and also elsewhere in the country. This organisation and the men and women in it remain committed to protecting Londoners, wherever they are in this city. That commitment is undiminished by these events and if anything that commitment is strengthened by these tragic circumstances.\u201d \nThe Met said extra patrols would be ordered on to the streets to offer reassurance. \nInvestigators are still appealing for information as they continue collecting evidence.

Questions remain after Freeman's guilty verdict", "Article": "In that golden decade when Team Sky and British Cycling won almost everything in sight, their media acolytes would often attribute their success to marginal gains, the pursuit of microscopic advantages in myriad areas, right down to washing hands before entering a building. \nHowever, a different form of handwashing took place after a medical tribunal in Manchester dispensed its guilty verdict against the former Team Sky and British Cycling doctor Richard Freeman for ordering banned testosterone \u201cknowing or believing\u201d it was for an unnamed rider. \n \n  Related: Suspicion stalked Sky but British public swallowed marginal gains story whole  \n \nFor in a statement released hours after the verdict, Ineos Grenadiers \u2013 formerly Team Sky \u2013 said Freeman had fallen \u201cshort of the ethical standards required of him as a doctor and acted dishonestly\u201d before adding that the \u201cteam does not believe that any athlete ever used or sought to use Testogel or any other performance enhancing substance. No evidence has been provided that this ever happened.\u201d \nIt was an attempt to scrub away a devastating verdict that will send shockwaves through British sport and to move on. But this case is too important for that to happen. And while it might sound a strange thing to say about a tribunal that has already lasted 765 days, this is not the end, nor even the beginning of the end. To borrow from Winston Churchill, it is perhaps the end of the beginning. \nThree crucial questions remain. First, who was the rider? Second, who else knew? And finally, was Team Sky and British Cycling\u2019s success down to marginal gains \u2013 or were medical ones involved too? \nClearly, Dr Freeman lied repeatedly \u2013 including to UK Anti-Doping investigators over ordering testosterone in 2011 \u2013 although there was no direct evidence in the 46-page summary of the case that he had doped a rider. Instead it seems the tribunal appears to have decided that Freeman had told so many falsehoods that his claims that he bought 30 sachets of Testogel for Sutton as he was being bullied by him should also be rejected. \nThe botched cover-up didn\u2019t help. At the end of the General Medical Council\u2019s case against Freeman, Simon Jackson QC painted a picture of an ambitious doctor driven to take risks \u2013 and prepared to break anti-doping rules to succeed. \u201cThere is a truism in life that it isn\u2019t the lie that gets you, it\u2019s the cover-up. And what a cover-up it has been,\u201d Jackson said. It was impossible to disagree. \nBut, watching Freeman \u2013 who has suffered from stress and serious mental problems which delayed the case \u2013 in the dock it was hard to believe that he had acted as a lone wolf. Indeed the GMC appeared to accept this point, too, given it claimed he was working with \u201csleepers\u201d in Team Sky and British Cycling who had previous knowledge of doping. \n \n  \n  \n  Richard Freeman in a 2018 interview with the BBC. It has been difficult to believe he had acted as a lone wolf. \n  Photograph: BBC Sport \n  \n \nThe mind is also cast back to the incident that started this grim affair \u2013 the mystery \u201cJiffy bag\u201d delivered from British Cycling\u2019s headquarters in Manchester to the Team Sky bus at the 2011 Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9. We still don\u2019t know for sure what it contained, despite Sir Dave Brailsford telling parliament that it contained Fluimucil, a legal decongestant. \nStrangely we never heard from Brailsford at this hearing, despite him leading both organisations in 2011. Indeed, Freeman\u2019s QC, Mary O\u2019Rourke, noted that Brailsford was \u201cthe spectre missing at these proceedings\u201d. It was an evocative image, and a fair point. As she said he \u201cwould have been able to answer an awful lot of questions about what was going on at British Cycling and Team Sky. Yet he was never called.\u201d \nThe tribunal also reinforced the sense that the rosy picture of marginal gains was rather different from the reality. Not only did Freeman not keep medical records, he lost or destroyed several laptops. He also claimed not to know about the benefits of testosterone \u2013 despite being one of the leading sports doctors in the country \u2013 and said he had \u201cno knowledge\u201d of the World Anti-Doping Code related to possessing banned substances. \nSteve Peters, the head of science at British Cycling, also displayed a striking lack of curiosity in not asking why Testogel had been ordered to the velodrome, after being told about the package by the physio Phil Burt, while Shane Sutton, the head coach, spent \u00a36,000 of British Cycling\u2019s money on cosmetic dentistry and was accused by the tribunal of \u201cengaging in bullying behaviour\u201d. For supposedly Rolls-Royce organisations, British Cycling and Team Sky had more than a whiff of the Del Boy. \nThe tribunal made it clear in its summing up that Sutton was a credible witness and did not demand testosterone to treat erectile dysfunction. Yet during the case it heard testimony that he had doped as a rider in 1987 \u2013 something Sutton denies \u2013 while O\u2019Rourke also suggested: \u201cOne possibility [for the Testogel] is that Sutton was getting it for nefarious purposes and had a rider he coached who wanted it.\u201d \n \n  Related: Team Sky and British Cycling in dock after Freeman guilty verdict  \n \nIn a statement after the guilty verdict, Sutton stressed neither he nor Brailsford knew about the testosterone order. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to find out who the doctor ordered it for,\u201d added Sutton. \u201cHopefully that will emerge from the investigation by UK Anti-Doping.\u201d On that, at least, most parties will agree. \nIt was Sutton, of course, who provided the most shocking moment of the hearings, when he denied using Testogel for impotence. \u201cI would have no problem in telling you it was for me,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are telling the press I can\u2019t get a hard-on \u2013 my wife wants to testify that you are a bloody liar.\u201d \nFrustratingly there were other interesting lines of inquiry that were not pursued. O\u2019Rourke, for instance, revealed she had written to Damian Collins MP \u2013 the author of a damning digital, culture, media and sport select committee report into British Cycling and Team Sky \u2013 because she had \u201cbeen given to believe he received a quantity of information which did not get published which related to Mr Sutton\u201d. \nShe also claimed the Daily Mail had a \u201cwitness statement or affidavit\u201d signed by Sutton. That was held in the managing editor of the newspaper\u2019s safe as \u201can insurance policy against any potential claims for defamation by Sir Bradley Wiggins, Freeman or Sir Dave Brailsford\u201d. But again, we got no further. \nDespite the guilty verdict it was also hard not to feel some sympathy for Freeman, especially when he detailed how the pressure of the allegations against him had taken its toll when he met Sky chiefs in Canary Wharf in 2017. \u201cI was on my own, living alone, isolated,\u201d he told the tribunal. \u201cI started drinking again, taking more sedative medication. I was on a slippery slope. I was due to give evidence to the DCMS select committee but I found it very daunting. \n\u201cI went down to see James Murdoch and Team Sky with Mr Eastwood to be briefed at an imposing building at Canary Wharf. Mike Morgan was there \u2013 who is a big person in sports law \u2013 and Rupert Murdoch\u2019s lawyer was over from Australia. It was very tense. Pressurised. They wanted to know how I would answer certain questions. I broke down in tears and couldn\u2019t go on.\u201d \nThere was, at least, a neat bit of symmetry on Friday \u2013 as a story that began with revelations about a Jiffy bag being delivered to the Team Sky bus, ended with its former chief doctor being left under one.", "Author": "Sean Ingle", "article_body_bow": [[0, 0.1787013325], [1, 0.1235723627], [2, 0.2797092946], [3, 0.1017453204], [11, 0.1577422709], [12, 0.185358544], [13, 0.0973578379], [15, 0.069793353], [19, 0.0788711355], [22, 0.0670181764], [24, 0.0932364315], [26, 0.1017453204], [28, 0.2570251429], [29, 0.0856750476], [30, 0.3729457261], [31, 0.0893506662], [33, 0.0893506662], [34, 0.370717088], [37, 0.0973578379], [38, 0.5140502857], [40, 0.1017453204], [41, 0.2680519987], [43, 0.1017453204], [47, 0.1017453204], [48, 0.0893506662], [49, 0.1017453204]]}, {"Source": "The Guardian", "Date": "2021-03-12", "Title": "Team Sky and British Cycling in dock after Freeman guilty verdict", "Article": "Team Sky and British Cycling\u2019s successes over the past decade have been left shrouded in suspicion after their former chief doctor Richard Freeman was found guilty of ordering banned testosterone \u201cknowing or believing\u201d it was for an unnamed rider to improve their performance. \nIn a devastating verdict that will send shockwaves through British sport, Freeman was also found guilty of concealing his conduct by orchestrating an elaborate cover-up after purchasing \u201ca doping \u2018drug of choice\u2019 for his sport\u201d. \nImmediately after the verdict, there were calls to find and identify the rider involved \u2013 while Clive Efford, a member of the digital, culture, media and sport select committee, called for Sir Dave Brailsford to be suspended by Ineos Grenadiers pending a full investigation. \u201cUntil this is cleared up, all those involved shouldn\u2019t be anywhere near the sport,\u201d he added. \n \n  Related: Marginal gains or medical gains? Questions remain after Freeman's guilty verdict  \n \nFreeman, who worked for Team Sky and British Cycling between 2009 and 2017, had already admitted to 18 charges against him including purchasing banned testosterone, lying to the UK Anti-Doping Agency and keeping haphazard records. But on Friday he also was found guilty of three more charges relating to the delivery of 30 sachets of Testogel \u2013 banned in and out of competition \u2013 to British Cycling and Team Sky headquarters in Manchester in May 2011. \nCrucially the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) said it found Freeman\u2019s claims that he had bought the banned drug for former British Cycling and Team Sky coach Shane Sutton to treat his erectile dysfunction were \u201cimplausible\u201d. \n\u201cAs a highly experienced doctor, the reason Dr Freeman claims to have ordered Testogel [to treat Mr Sutton] was unconvincing in itself,\u201d it added. \u201cIt stretched credulity that a high-profile, experienced sports doctor would order a potential banned substance under the World Anti-Doping Agency code; yet, despite the significance of this, fail to make a record of the intended patient, the circumstances, and the proposed off-label use. \n\u201cThe tribunal found that Dr Freeman\u2019s account of having ordered the Testogel for Mr Sutton required it to believe too many implausible, unsupported assertions, as well as having to overlook further falsehoods, on the back of those Dr Freeman had already admitted. \n\u201cThe position therefore is this. In May 2011, Dr Freeman, the team doctor for a team of elite cyclists \u2026 ordered a doping \u2018drug of choice\u2019 for that sport. Upon its arrival he was dishonest about why it had been sent, removed it from the Velodrome, and it was never seen again.\u201d Freeman had claimed last year that he had taken the testosterone home with him and flushed it down the sink but the tribunal noted that they only had his word. \n\u201cBearing in mind the breadth of Dr Freeman\u2019s dishonesty and the number of people he had pulled into it, the tribunal found his conduct incapable of innocent explanation,\u201d the MPTS report concluded. \u201cIt was clear that, on the balance of probabilities, the inference could properly be drawn that when Dr Freeman placed the order and obtained the Testogel, he knew or believed it was to be administered to an athlete to improve their athletic performance.\u201d The identity of the rider for whom the testosterone was allegedly ordered has never been established, nor did the General Medical Council attempt to prove it. \nSpeaking after the verdict, Sutton admitted the decision had cast a cloud over both Team Sky and British Cycling. \u201cI\u2019m saddened by the whole affair,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel for the doctor; that he ever got into this situation, and I remain disappointed that I was used as a scapegoat. It has caused great pain to both me and my family. But it also saddens me that this episode has cast a huge shadow over the success we enjoyed, both at Team Sky and British Cycling. \n\u201cI\u2019d like to stress that neither I nor Sir Dave Brailsford knew about the testosterone order,\u201d he added. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s important to find out who the doctor ordered it for. Hopefully that will emerge from the investigation by UK Anti-Doping.\u201d \nThe tribunal accepted that Sutton had been a \u201cscratchy and irascible character\u201d who, \u201cwhen under pressure would indeed engage in bullying behaviour\u201d. However, it said there was no evidence that Sutton had been bullying Freeman in 2011 and they found him a credible witness. \nThe protracted case, which was expected to last a month when it began in February 2019, has dragged on for more than two years. However, Friday\u2019s verdict does not yet mark its end. It will sit again for three days next week to assess whether Freeman\u2019s licence to practice is impaired \u2013 and then again in April to deliberate on whether he should lose his doctor\u2019s licence or face any other punishments for his behaviour. \n \n  Related: Suspicion stalked Sky but British public swallowed marginal gains story whole  \n \nFreeman will also face two UK Anti-Doping charges related to ordering banned testosterone, including possession of a prohibited substance and tampering. \nIn a statement, Ineos Grenadiers \u2013 formally Team Sky \u2013 admitted that it was \u201cvery clear from the tribunal\u2019s report that Freeman had fallen short of the ethical standards required of him as a doctor and acted dishonestly\u201d. But it added: \u201cHowever the Team does not believe that any athlete ever used or sought to use Testogel or any other performance-enhancing substance. No evidence has been provided that this ever happened or that there has been any wrongdoing by any athlete at any point.\u201d \nMeanwhile Brian Cookson, the president of British Cycling between 1996 and 2013, called upon Freeman to give a full and frank account to UK Anti-Doping. \u201cIn many different ways, my team and I worked long and hard to ensure that success was well-founded on principles of integrity, fair play and competing within the rules, including and especially with respect to anti-doping,\u201d he added. \nHowever Damian Collins MP, the former chairman of the digital, culture, media and sport committee, said it posed \u201cmajor questions for British sport\u201d as well as British Cycling and Team Sky. \n \n  \n \n  Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n  \n \n\u201cHow could the chief doctor for Team Sky and British Cycling order a banned substance \u2018knowing or believing\u2019 it was to help a rider cheat the anti-doping rules?\u201d he asked. \u201cWas this a one off, who was the recipient, why was there supposedly no supervision of what he was ordering? This case is not just about the failure of one man to adhere to the rules and the standards expected of him, but a failure at that time of the management of the teams he worked for, including the national governing body of the sport.\u201d Meanwhile Efford said the ruling against Freeman exposed Team Sky\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d approach to doping as having been \u201ca tissue of lies\u201d. \n\u201cDave Brailsford gave reassurances about how clean his teams were and unless he was in full control of what was going on, he couldn\u2019t make those assurances,\u201d he added. \nWada said it had noted \u201cwith concern\u201d the decision and said it would work to support the authorities in the case \u201cto ensure that all possible lines of enquiry are exhausted.\u201dIt added: \u201cA number of questions still remain unanswered, such as the identity of the rider or riders who were the intended recipients of the prohibited substance ordered by Dr Freeman, and who else, if anyone, had knowledge of his actions.\u201d", "Author": "Sean Ingle", "article_body_bow": [[0, 0.6564272002], [1, 0.0648458352], [2, 0.0978535028], [3, 0.1067837522], [4, 0.1021790014], [5, 0.0648458352], [6, 0.1067837522], [9, 0.0505282069], [10, 0.0899176789], [12, 0.0648458352], [13, 0.1021790014], [14, 0.0505282069], [15, 0.2929980888], [16, 0.0703369188], [17, 0.1021790014], [19, 0.2483305104], [22, 0.2813476754], [23, 0.1021790014], [24, 0.0978535028], [25, 0.0827768368], [36, 0.1957070056], [37, 0.1021790014], [38, 0.3596707157], [40, 0.1067837522], [41, 0.0937753143], [43, 0.1067837522], [47, 0.1067837522]]}, {"Source": "The New York Times", "Date": "2021-03-01", "Title": "How to watch the Golden Globes on TV and Online.", "Article": "When the 78th annual Golden Globes are handed out on Sunday, they will be the first major awards show of the season, coming nearly two months after we would typically find out the best picture winner.The ceremony begins at 8 p.m. Eastern, 5 p.m. Pacific.

And in the latest innovation in streaming, Discovery+ includes a channel that lets you watch it for four days straight without seeing the same episode twice.If you\u2019re not familiar with the six-year-old show, as a surprisingly large share of New Yorkers (my editors here, shamefully, included) are, the 90 days of the title refers to the period in which the noncitizen holder of a K-1 visa may remain in the country before marriage or face deportation. The show chronicles couples through that period, complete with skeptical in-laws, bickering and the enchantment or disenchantment with Nebraska or New Hampshire, all with countdown music and chyrons like \u201c73 Days to Wed.\u201dNow, on the Discovery+ show \u201c90 Days Bares All\u201d (one of about a dozen spinoffs, including \u201c90 Day Fianc\u00e9: Self-Quarantined\u201d), the show can \u201cpush the boundaries even further versus the standards and practices of a regular cable channel,\u201d said Howard Lee, the president of TLC, one of the cable networks that make up Discovery\u2019s U.S. business. So you can watch the couples scream curses at one another, unbleeped, or discuss their favorite sex toys.\n\nThe biggest story in big media these days is the \u201cstreaming wars,\u201d the scramble by the people who traditionally make TV and movies to catch up with Netflix. Disney is dominating the race for second place; it\u2019s unclear who else will even survive. CBS limps to the party next month with Paramount+, with the hopeful (to the company) and terrifying (to consumers) suggestion that normal, content-addicted Americans will wind up putting down their credit cards for five different streaming services.\n\nDiscovery, the dominant programmer of what used to be called \u201creality TV\u201d and it now prefers to call \u201creal life,\u201d has emerged as perhaps the most successful new entrant to this complicated, high-stakes competition. It is bringing along a mostly female audience. The company says it has 12 million paid subscriptions around the world, a more than respectable start that has helped make the company\u2019s stock among the best performing on the S&P 500 this year (though it\u2019s also riding a broader wave in the market).The app, which was introduced on Jan. 4, has a sheer mass of content that rivals Netflix, with 55,000 episodes \u2014 and it\u2019s rolling out a suite of exclusive content dominated by American cultural figures like Oprah Winfrey, a procession of People cover fixtures led by Chip and Joanna Gaines and pop icons including the chef Guy Fieri. (Discovery also bid nine figures for a deal with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, but the couple chose to go with Netflix, which has been less insistent on exclusivity, two people familiar with the conversations said.)The app\u2019s early success is partly the result of a deal with Verizon, and Discovery won\u2019t disclose the share of its subscriptions coming via that route; it also won\u2019t say how many subscriptions are for an unrelated European sports service. (A media analyst, Michael Nathanson, estimates that Verizon provided about 20 percent of the five million subscriptions in the United States.) But the surge in new sign-ups this year beat analysts\u2019 expectations, initial validation of the company\u2019s big bet that delivering shows through new apps on a range of devices is now a fully mainstream phenomenon. And as the hype falls away about technical bells and whistles and using new kinds of data to predict people\u2019s interests, the audience still loves watching people fix houses, tour diners, crawl around sewers and bicker about their relationships.\u201cOur bet is when the world makes a full rotation, that the content people have chosen when they could choose anything on TV or cable, the content that they love and run home for \u2014 \u201890 Day,\u2019 \u2018Fixer Upper,\u2019 \u2018Property Brothers\u2019 \u2014 they\u2019re still going to love that,\u201d said David M. Zaslav, the president and chief executive of Discovery. \u201cIn the end, people really don\u2019t change that much.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s Mr. Zaslav\u2019s unromantic version of the old declaration that content is king. And it\u2019s a punctuation mark to a media era that began with a vertiginous sense of transformation. It has instead devolved into me explaining to my 11-year-old Disney\u2019s devious strategy of releasing a single episode of \u201cWandaVision\u201d at the same time each week, producing an experience mysteriously identical to the way we used to watch television.\n\nMr. Zaslav, too, is the last of his kind \u2014 the \u201clast tycoon,\u201d his old friend, the former HBO chief executive Richard Plepler, told me. He\u2019s a relentless, fleece-vested mogul who likes to call reporters to talk his own book (and caught me on Tuesday morning in a moment of panic about what I would write this week). He likes to visit his stars at home, and to keep them close. He pals around with Disney\u2019s former chief, Bob Iger, and Mr. Plepler, and others who rose by creating television and films. But those companies are now run by people who come out of other parts of the business \u2014 telecommunications or apps or theme parks. He\u2019s a Hamptons mainstay who also holds an annual \u201cboys\u2019 dinner\u201d for 50 of his closest male friends, including Apple\u2019s content chief Eddy Cue and the Netflix co-chief executive Ted Sarandos, in Los Angeles. The dinner is held during a golf tournament to which Discovery holds the television rights.The smooth start of Discovery+ comes as streamers closer to the heart of the media class are struggling. Apple\u2019s service is off to a slow start. WarnerMedia\u2019s HBO Max has been defined by stumbles. But Discovery remains in an odd position in the media business: The company, which is valued at more than $23 billion, is far smaller than the handful of dominant media and telecommunications conglomerates. But it is too big to be acquired by any but a few companies. There\u2019s a running debate among those who know Mr. Zaslav about whether he\u2019s buying or selling \u2014 that is, whether Discovery+ is another move to make the company more attractive for a giant to swallow before the bottom really falls out of the U.S. cable business or whether the company\u2019s current high stock price will prompt Mr. Zaslav to acquire other businesses.\u201cHe should use this opportunity to make his business stronger,\u201d said Mr. Nathanson, the media analyst, who suggested that Discovery \u201cbuy CNN.\u201dMr. Zaslav, who was involved in the creation of CNBC and MSNBC as an executive at NBC from 1989 to 2006, has begun to play in the global news business. Discovery is an investor in GB News, a right-of-center television challenger to the BBC. In Poland this year, the Discovery-owned channel TVN went dark along with other media outlets to protest the latest government attempt to hobble independent media. Mr. Zaslav said the investments in those channels were part of a strategy to sell streaming services as a bundle with news and sports.But he said he hadn\u2019t talked to CNN\u2019s president, Jeff Zucker, an East Hampton golf partner, about buying the network from its parent company, AT&T, and signaled that he was leery of the political charge that comes with top-shelf American cable news.\n\n\u201cNews is very overplayed and excoriated here in the U.S.,\u201d he said.Discovery has its own nuanced cultural politics, which are the subject of a whole school of cultural criticism. The success of \u201c90 Day\u201d tracked Donald Trump\u2019s xenophobic rise, and the show was \u201cso rooted in real-world consequences and the real lives of these people that it often feels too tender to touch,\u201d Scaachi Koul wrote in 2019. \u201cThe politics of immigration and class and race and gender are so present in every episode, you sometimes have to watch through the cracks of your eyelids.\u201dMuch of the company\u2019s audience emphatically includes Donald Trump\u2019s America (though shows like \u201c90 Day\u201d also have cult followings among, say, readers of New York Magazine\u2019s Vulture). Some of its programming is resolutely anti-coastal. But its casting is inclusive, its couples diverse. And its programming also offers a clue as to why Republican attempts to revive, in particular, anti-L.G.B.T. culture war attacks have lost some of their political effectiveness. TLC\u2019s version of real life regularly includes an array of couples. One \u201c90 Day\u201d spinoff tells the story of an American-born partner relocating to his husband\u2019s native Mexico and grappling with overt homophobia. At one point, looking up at a giant statue of Jesus Christ in Cantamar, the American-born partner reassures his husband, \u201cI think he would approve of us.\u201dThe tensest relationships for Mr. Zaslav, as for the other streamers, are with distributors. The chairman of the Dish Network last week warned Discovery that selling content through the app could mean lower fees from cable companies and other pay TV operators. But that threat hasn\u2019t materialized yet.The bigger question may be if and when the service will develop an identity, or high-profile programming, that feels more than a supplement to the television network. It is an experiment, as my colleague John Koblin wrote, in whether people will pay $5 a month (or $7 without ads) for a service that plays in the background while you fold laundry or pay the bills.\n\nSo far, the exclusive content is mostly for superfans of specific shows, with occasional experiments with formats that don\u2019t fit neatly onto cable. One early attempt is \u201cBen\u2019s Workshop,\u201d which the host, Ben Napier, said he was pleased that Discovery+ had picked up. \u201cPeople kept saying, \u2018Ben should have a woodworking show\u2019 and I kept retweeting it and tagging the network and saying we should do this,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t care if it was going to be a social media-only show. I really wanted to make the show.\u201d And Mr. Fieri told me he\u2019s shooting four episodes of an adventure show in Hawaii for the service that \u201cwouldn\u2019t have been able to sit right in that mainstream track of doing what Food Network does.\u201dBut the company says it will increasingly put more of its desirable content there first, including a drinking show featuring the chef Ina Garten and the actress Melissa McCarthy, as well as shows with the promising titles, \u201cAmy Schumer Learns to Cook: Uncensored\u201d and \u201cJudi Dench\u2019s Wild Borneo Adventure.\u201d\n\nAnd while the emergence of Discovery+ is mostly an indication that shifting distribution technologies haven\u2019t changed American tastes, that doesn\u2019t mean the shift is without consequence. Sunny Anderson, a co-host of \u201cThe Kitchen\u201d on the Food Network, said she had been \u2014 mostly \u2014 enjoying a wave of feedback about older content.Last week, a viewer messaged her to congratulate her on her weight loss.\u201cI thought, what did they watch? I haven\u2019t lost any weight,\u201d she said, then realized that they were deep in her library, watching old episodes of her show \u201cCooking for Real.\u201d She said she had to reply, \u201cYou\u2019re watching me 10 years ago, I\u2019ve actually gained weight.\u201d", "Author": "Ben Smith", "article_body_bow": [[1, 0.1386118047], [3, 0.0760855269], [4, 0.1456091024], [5, 0.2310196745], [7, 0.1521710538], [9, 0.3960257698], [10, 0.1281362349], [11, 0.1769403803], [13, 0.1456091024], [14, 0.0360023427], [16, 0.2505822009], [17, 0.0728045512], [19, 0.0589801268], [22, 0.4009315214], [24, 0.0697225483], [25, 0.1769403803], [26, 0.0760855269], [27, 0.0640681174], [28, 0.0640681174], [29, 0.0640681174], [31, 0.0668167586], [32, 0.2282565806], [33, 0.2004502759], [34, 0.1386118047], [35, 0.192490232], [36, 0.0697225483], [37, 0.1456091024], [38, 0.0640681174], [39, 0.0668167586], [40, 0.1521710538], [41, 0.1336335173], [44, 0.0640681174], [46, 0.0697225483], [48, 0.0668167586], [50, 0.3486127414]]}, {"Source": "The New York Times", "Date": "2021-03-01", "Title": "Voter Suppression Is Grand Larceny", "Article": "In 1890, Mississippi became one of the first states in the country to call a constitutional convention for the express purpose of writing white supremacy into the DNA of the state.At the time, a majority of the registered voters in the state were Black men.The lone Black delegate to the convention, Isaiah Montgomery, participated in openly suppressing the voting eligibility of most of those Black men, in the hope that this would reduce the terror, intimidation and hostility that white supremacists aimed at Black people.\n\nThe committee on which he sat went even further. As he said at the convention:\u201cAs a further precaution to secure unquestioned white supremacy the committee have fixed an arbitrary appointment of the state, which fixes the legislative branch of the government at 130 members and the senatorial branch at 45 members.\u201d The majority of the seats in both branches were \u201cfrom white constituencies.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to the Black people he was disenfranchising, Montgomery said:\u201cI wish to tell them that the sacrifice has been made to restore confidence, the great missing link between the two races, to restore honesty and purity to the ballot-box and to confer the great boon of political liberty upon the Commonwealth of Mississippi.\u201dThat sacrifice backfired horribly, as states across the South followed the Mississippi example, suppressing the Black vote, and Jim Crow reigned.That same sort of language is being used today to prevent people from voting, because when it comes to voter suppression, ignoble intentions are always draped in noble language. Those who seek to impede others from voting, in some cases to strip them of the right, often say that they are doing so to ensure the sanctity, integrity or purity of the vote.However, when the truth is laid bare, the defilement against which they rail is the voting power of the racial minority, the young \u2014 in their eyes, na\u00efve and liberally indoctrinated \u2014 and the dyed-in-the-wool Democrats.In early February, a Brennan Center for Justice report detailed:\u201cThus far this year, thirty-three states have introduced, prefiled, or carried over 165 bills to restrict voting access. These proposals primarily seek to: (1) limit mail voting access; (2) impose stricter voter ID requirements; (3) slash voter registration opportunities; and (4) enable more aggressive voter roll purges. These bills are an unmistakable response to the unfounded and dangerous lies about fraud that followed the 2020 election.\u201d\n\nOn Feb. 24, the center updated its account to reveal that \u201cas of February 19, 2021, state lawmakers have carried over, prefiled, or introduced 253 bills with provisions that restrict voting access in 43 states.\u201dBut it is the coded language that harkens to the post-Reconstruction era racism that strikes me.In Georgia, which went for a Democrat for the first time since Bill Clinton in 1992 and just elected two Democratic senators \u2014 one Black and one Jewish \u2014 there have been a raft of proposed voter restrictions. As State Representative Barry Fleming, a Republican and chair of the newly formed Special Committee on Election Integrity, put it recently, according to The Washington Post, \u201cOur due diligence in this legislature [is] to constantly update our laws to try to protect the sanctity of the vote.\u201dKelly Loeffler, who lost her Senate bid in the state, has launched a voter organization because, as she said, \u201cfor too many in our state, the importance \u2014 and even the sanctity of their vote \u2014 is in question.\u201d She continued, \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re rolling up our sleeves to register conservative-leaning voters who have been overlooked, to regularly engage more communities, and to strengthen election integrity across our state.\u201dSenator Rick Scott and other Republicans on Feb. 25 introduced the Save Democracy Act in what they said was an effort to \u201crestore confidence in our elections.\u201dJessica Anderson of the conservative lobbying organization Heritage Action for America said of the legislation: \u201cI applaud Senator Scott for putting forward common-sense, targeted reforms to help protect the integrity of our federal elections and the sanctity of the vote. The Save Democracy Act will protect against fraud and restore American\u2019s confidence in our election systems while respecting the state\u2019s sovereignty.\u201dGov. Ron DeSantis of Florida is pushing a slate of restrictive voter laws that would make it harder for Democrats to win in the state. On his website, the announcement read this way: \u201cToday, Governor Ron DeSantis proposed new measures to safeguard the sanctity of Florida elections. The Governor\u2019s announcement reaffirms his commitment to the integrity of every vote and the importance of transparency in Florida elections.\u201dThey can use all manner of euphemism to make it sound honorable, but it is not. This is an electoral fleecing in plain sight, one targeting people of color. We are watching another of history\u2019s racist robberies.

Trump would fade from the political scene like other past presidents evaporated fully on Sunday as he spoke for more than 90 minutes in a grievance-filled and self-promoting address that sought to polish up his presidential legacy, take aim at his enemies and tease his political future.Here are six takeaways from the first major Republican gathering of the post-Trump era, the 2021 Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, Fla.Trump has (almost) total dominance.\u201cI am not starting a new party,\u201d Mr. Trump declared, nixing rumors and making news in the first moments of the first speech of his post-presidency.And why would he? Mr. Trump remains the most influential Republican politician in the nation. The three-day CPAC gathering in Orlando showed how fully the Republican Party has been remade in his image in the five years since he boycotted the conference in 2016 en route to capturing the party\u2019s nomination.\n\nIn a meandering speech guided by a teleprompter and interrupted with cheering that at times read more obligatory than enthusiastic, Mr. Trump lashed out at President Biden and outlined his vision of a culture- and immigration-focused Republican Party while relitigating his specific grievances from 2020.Mr. Trump named every Republican who voted for his impeachment. \u201cGet rid of them all,\u201d he said. And he predicted a Republican would win the White House in 2024. \u201cWho, who, who will that be, I wonder?\u201d he mused.The speech came right after Mr. Trump won a CPAC 2024 presidential straw poll, finishing with 55 percent of the vote \u2014 more than double the percentage of his closest runner-up. But that victory was dampened by the fact that only 68 percent of the attendees at the conference said they wanted him to run again.A second straw poll, without Mr. Trump, was carried by Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, who received 43 percent on his home turf, followed by Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota with 11 percent.Those results showcased the challenge that senators face in edging ahead of governors in the 2024 pack of potential presidential candidates. Both Mr. DeSantis and Ms. Noem highlighted their efforts to keep the economy open during the coronavirus pandemic, which proved a more popular r\u00e9sum\u00e9 point than the legislative fights that senators in Washington have been engaged in.\n\n\u2018Cancel culture\u2019 is the new \u2018fake news.\u2019In his first presidential bid, Mr. Trump adopted \u201cfake news\u201d as a rallying cry against the traditional news media and then effectively and relentlessly deployed it to position himself as the sole arbiter of truth for his supporters.The lineup of CPAC speakers over the weekend showed how thoroughly a new pair of catchphrases \u2014 \u201ccancel culture\u201d and the \u201cwoke mob\u201d \u2014 are animating a Republican Party that, beyond supporting Mr. Trump, appears increasingly centered on defining itself in opposition to the left.\u201cDidn\u2019t anybody tell you?\u201d Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri began his CPAC speech. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be canceled.\u201dThe crowd cheered as \u201ccancel culture\u201d served throughout the weekend as shorthand for bashing the news media, railing against the tech industry (in particular, Twitter\u2019s and Facebook\u2019s decisions to bar Mr. Trump from their platforms), and spreading fear about the decline of conservative and religious values in American popular culture.Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, one of his party\u2019s most adroit culture warriors, summarized the annoyance and alienation felt by attendees at the right-wing gathering because of the continuing pandemic.\u201cYou can French kiss the guy next to you yelling \u2018Abolish the police\u2019 and no one will get infected,\u201d he mocked. \u201cBut if you go to church and say \u2018Amazing grace,\u2019 everyone is going to die.\u201d\n\nA \u2018rigged\u2019 2020 is now a G.O.P. article of faith.T.W. Shannon, a Republican from Oklahoma, was the first to say it. Speaking Friday morning on a panel called \u201cTolerance Reimagined: The Angry Mob and Violence in Our Streets,\u201d Mr. Shannon said the reason pro-Trump demonstrators stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 was that \u201cthey felt hopeless.\u201d\n\nAnd that, he said, was \u201cbecause of a rigged election.\u201dThe election was not rigged, of course, but by the end of CPAC it was clear that the lie Mr. Trump had promoted vigorously had become canon among the base of the Republican Party. On Sunday, the conference\u2019s straw poll results revealed that 62 percent of attendees ranked \u201celection integrity\u201d as the most important issue facing the country.For those who tuned into Mr. Hawley\u2019s speech, this was probably unsurprising: Mr. Hawley, who was the first Senate Republican to announce his plans to object to the Electoral College certification, electrified the CPAC audience when he reminded them of his defiance.\u201cOn Jan. 6, I objected to the Electoral College certification \u2014 maybe you heard about it,\u201d Mr. Hawley said with a wry grin. People erupted in applause.In interviews, multiple CPAC attendees were adamant that widespread voter fraud had led to the election of Mr. Biden \u2014 and some inadvertently suggested the long-term consequences this could pose for the party.Pamela Roehl, 55, who traveled to the conference from Illinois, said some of her pro-Trump friends had written off civic engagement for good. \u201cThey voted for Trump, and they said they\u2019re not going to vote again, because they just feel like it\u2019s so tainted,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that is just so sad.\u201dThere was little interest in policy \u2014 whether Biden\u2019s or the Republican Party\u2019s.As the conference began, House Democrats were preparing to approve a coronavirus relief package worth nearly $2 trillion that was opposed by every House Republican. But inside the Hyatt Regency in Orlando, it was hard to find many conservatives who cared.\n\nCPAC in past years has served, at minimum, as a forum for conservatives to unite in opposition to a Democratic policy agenda. But most speakers over the weekend won applause by channeling the preoccupation with personality over policy that animated the party during Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency. The result was an event in which conservatives signaled their lack of interest not just in mobilizing against Mr. Biden\u2019s policies, but also in debating the finer points of their own.Mr. DeSantis suggested that the current threat posed by the left was too dangerous for conservatives to prioritize policy discussions.\u201cWe can sit around and have academic debates about conservative policy \u2014 we can do that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the question is, when the Klieg lights get hot, when the left comes after you: Will you stay strong, or will you fold?\u201dIn an illustration of how Mr. Trump has transformed the party, there was strikingly little mention of curbing spending at a moment when congressional Democrats are moving to restore earmarks. And while CPAC attendees ranked immigration as the third most important issue facing the country, few speakers discussed specific policy proposals to shape the party\u2019s stance on the issue beyond continuing to support Mr. Trump\u2019s border wall.\n\nKristi Noem is hailed as \u2018a female Trump.\u2019Ms. Noem, who came in second to Mr. DeSantis in the CPAC straw poll without Mr. Trump, was one of the standout speakers of the weekend, delivering a staunchly pro-Trump message and highlighting the anti-lockdown and anti-mask policies that in the past year have made her a darling of the base of the Republican Party.She jolted to stardom in Republican circles last year when she refused to issue a lockdown order for South Dakota or to enforce a mask mandate. Instead, she advocated \u201cwashing your hands and making good decisions.\u201d\n\nSouth Dakota now has the country\u2019s eighth-highest death rate from Covid-19.Ms. Noem received a standing ovation at CPAC when she boasted that she had never ordered a \u201csingle business or church to close,\u201d and another one when she attacked Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert.In the hours leading up to her speech on Saturday, many attendees praised Ms. Noem as their favorite Republican \u2014 apart from Mr. Trump, of course.\u201cI like Kristi Noem because she fights back,\u201d said Sany Dash, who sold pro-Trump merchandise at the conference. \u201cI feel like she\u2019s a female Trump, except not crass or rude. \u201dThe Republican \u2018civil war\u2019 remains very much uncanceled.Senator Rick Scott of Florida, who runs the Republican political committee trying to win back the Senate in 2022, tried to downplay any intraparty disagreements and urged activists to focus on opposing the Democratic agenda.The problem is that some of his party\u2019s biggest names \u2014 including and especially Mr. Trump \u2014 are focused first on exacting revenge for those who strayed from the Trump party line on impeachment.Donald Trump Jr. excoriated Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the top-ranking Republican to vote to impeach his father, as aggressively as he did any Democrat in his speech. Mr. Trump on Friday announced that one of his first 2022 endorsements would be for the primary opponent of Representative Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio, another Republican who voted for impeachment. The mere mention of Senator Mitt Romney\u2019s name drew derision.In his own speech, Mr. Trump named every Republican who voted for his impeachment in the House and for conviction in the Senate, focusing special attention on Ms. Cheney, whom he called a \u201cwarmonger.\u201d\n\nBut even if there are critical parts of the Republican apparatus at war, the activist flank of the party remains firmly behind Mr. Trump. Or, as he put it, \u201cThe only division is between a handful of Washington, D.C., establishment political hacks and everybody else.\u201dThere were no more surefire applause lines than those that heaped praise on the former president.When Donald Trump Jr. jokingly called the gathering \u201cTPAC\u201d instead of CPAC \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s what it feels like, guys!\u201d he said \u2014 it felt less like an awkward joke and more a statement of 2021 reality.", "Author": "Shane Goldmacher and Elaina Plott", "article_body_bow": [[1, 0.1149348604], [2, 0.0867193603], [4, 0.0905526872], [5, 0.3448045813], [6, 0.0946334921], [9, 0.044778916], [11, 0.0733581745], [14, 0.044778916], [16, 0.1246674351], [17, 0.1811053745], [18, 0.3468774412], [19, 0.2200745235], [20, 0.1811053745], [21, 0.0704166893], [22, 0.0623337176], [23, 0.2716580617], [25, 0.146716349], [28, 0.0796865045], [29, 0.2390595136], [30, 0.0867193603], [33, 0.1662104071], [34, 0.0574674302], [35, 0.1795613134], [36, 0.2601580809], [37, 0.2716580617], [41, 0.1662104071], [45, 0.1246674351], [46, 0.1734387206], [47, 0.2839004762], [48, 0.0831052036], [49, 0.1892669841], [50, 0.0867193603]]}, {"Source": "The New York Times", "Date": "2021-03-01", "Title": "Golden Globes Winners 2021: The Complete List", "Article": "Streaming services dominated Sunday night\u2019s Golden Globe Awards ceremony.Four categories were taken by Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Crown.\u201d The top film categories were taken by \u201cNomadland,\u201d which is on Hulu, and \u201cBorat Subsequent Moviefilm\u201d on Amazon Prime.

On Sunday night at the Golden Globes, Amy Poehler and Tina Fey managed to convey their signature chemistry and cheeky brand of comedy while deftly hosting from opposite ends of the country: Fey at the Rainbow Room in Rockefeller Center in New York, and Poehler at the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills. The rooms were not completely empty: first responders sat at tables, masked and socially distant.A clever split-screen and some cunning video work made the broadcast look like they were side by side, including a moment where Fey appeared to stroke Poehler\u2019s hair. \u201cThe technology is so great, you are never going to be able to tell the difference,\u201d Poehler said. Here\u2019s their exchange kicking off the ceremony. It has been lightly edited.\n\nFey: Hello. Oh, good evening world. I\u2019m Tina Fey coming to you from the beautiful Rainbow Room in New York City, where indoor dining and outdoor muggings are back.\n\nPoehler: Yes, and I\u2019m Amy Poehler, here at the Beverly Hilton, District 7, New Angeles, and this is the 78th annual Hunger Games \u2014Fey: Golden Globes.Poehler: Golden Globes. Now, Tina and I are hosting from two different cities tonight, but the technology is so great, you are never going to be able to tell the difference. It\u2019s going to be smooth sailing.Fey: You won\u2019t even notice. Oh, I\u2019ve missed you, my love. I always knew my career would end with me wandering around the Rainbow Room, pretending to talk to Amy. I just thought it would be later. But what an exciting night. All of the big blockbuster movies that came out of this year are nominated: \u201cParts of a Lady,\u201d \u201cIrish Goodnight,\u201d \u201cMauricio\u2019s Delve.\u201dPoehler: \u201cDay Planner,\u201d \u201cGronk,\u201d \u201cAli G Goes to Chicago.\u201dFey: And we will be honoring all of the fantastic TV shows you binge watched this year: the American \u201cOffice,\u201d old \u201cColumbos,\u201d very one-sided news programs.Poehler: The Zoom town halls about your school staying closed, and of course, the cranberry juice skateboard guy. He\u2019s going to skateboard to all of the nominated songs tonight. How exciting.\n\nFey: Now, normally, this room is full of celebrities, but tonight, our audience on both coasts is made up of smoking hot first responders and essential workers. How gorgeous. We are so grateful for the work that you do and that you\u2019re here so that the celebrities can stay safely at home.Poehler: Yes, thank you so much. Now, we know that you have seen a lot of crazy stuff at your job this year. But you have not seen the kind of stuff that we\u2019ve seen at previous Golden Globes. This front table right here usually houses the biggest stars in the world.Fey: It\u2019s usually like Meryl Streep, just hammered, can\u2019t even remember what movie she\u2019s there for.Poehler: Brad Pitt\u2019s always waving at me like: Amy, Amy. And I\u2019m like, dude, I\u2019m working. It\u2019s like, not now.Fey: And Oprah Winfrey just writing her name all over the tablecloth in pen.Poehler: Quentin Tarantino crawling under the tables, just touching people\u2019s feet. The point is, do whatever you want, because they do.Fey: Those bitches are messy.Poehler: Yeah, they\u2019re messy. OK, so since you guys aren\u2019t usually here, let us explain what this even is. The Golden Globes are awards given out by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association.Fey: The Hollywood Foreign Press Association is made up of around 90 international \u2014 no Black \u2014 journalists, who attend movie junkets each year in search of a better life. We say around 90 because a couple of them might be ghosts, and it\u2019s rumored that the German member is just a sausage that somebody drew a little face on.\n\nPoehler: At the Golden Globes we give out awards for movies and TV, but I mean it\u2019s hard to tell them apart this year because movie theaters were closed and we watched everything on our phones.Fey: So you may be confused which nominees count as movies and which are considered TV.Poehler: Now TV is the one that I watch five hours straight, but a movie is the one that I don\u2019t turn on because it\u2019s two hours. I don\u2019t want to be in front of my TV for two hours, I want to be in front of the TV for one hour five times.Fey: I think the rule is, if their fake teeth look real, that\u2019s a movie. And if their real teeth look fake, that\u2019s TV.Poehler: If the British actors are playing British people, it\u2019s TV; if they\u2019re playing Americans, it\u2019s a movie.Fey: If you\u2019re like, Mario Lopez is surprisingly good in this, that\u2019s TV.Poehler: And if it stars Matthew McConaughey as a poetic drifter, it\u2019s a car commercial.Fey: We watch TV and movies differently. Like in movies, it\u2019s called human trafficking, but on TV, it\u2019s called \u201c90-Day Fianc\u00e9.\u201d\n\nPoehler: And if it\u2019s a play that has been turned into a movie, but you watch it on a TV, it\u2019s called the Plovie, and there are at least four of them nominated tonight.Fey: Ah, congratulations to all the Plovies. So, let\u2019s see what these European weirdos nominated this year. \u201cNomadland\u201d is a movie where Frances McDormand plays a lady who travels across the desert in her van and poops in a bucket. And my kids were like, \u201cCould we do that for spring break? Could we do anything?\u201dPoehler: \u201cMank\u201d is short for Mankiewicz, the name of the screenwriter of \u201cCitizen Kane.\u201d And that is the only thing they shortened.Fey: \u201cThe Queen\u2019s Gambit\u201d is whatever James Corden was up to in \u201cThe Prom,\u201d I guess. \u201cThe Prom\u201d came out at the perfect time because this year so many teenagers didn\u2019t get to go to their prom, so they could watch James Corden and Meryl Streep go to it instead, and that\u2019s still fun, right guys?Poehler: \u201cThe Trial of the Chicago 7\u201d I think is the best of all the \u201cTrial of Chicago\u201d movies, but it\u2019s still not as good as \u201cPolice Academy 7: Mission to Moscow.\u201d Who\u2019s with me?Fey: The thing I love about Aaron Sorkin\u2019s writing is he can have seven men talking but it feels like a hundred men talking.\n\nPoehler: Yeah. \u201cThe Undoing\u201d was a sexy and dramatic mystery where Nicole Kidman\u2019s coat is suspected of murdering her wig.Fey: \u201cSoul\u201d is a beautiful Pixar animated movie where a middle-aged Black man\u2019s soul accidentally gets knocked out of his body and into a cat. The H.F.P.A. really responded to this movie because they do have five cat members.Poehler: \u201cNormal People\u201d is an emotional show about two young lovers in Ireland and is best viewed in bed with your hot laptop right on your crotch.Fey: \u201cOne Night in Miami\u201d is a fictionalized version of a meeting that took place between Malcolm X, Cassius Clay, Sam Cooke and Jim Brown, where I assume the topic of discussion was, how the hell do we get out of Florida?Poehler: Speaking of \u201cOne Night in Miami,\u201d there are great directors nominated tonight. Regina King for \u201cOne Night in Miami,\u201d Chlo\u00e9 Zhao for \u201cNomadland,\u201d Emerald Fennell for \u201cPromising Young Woman\u201d and two other people, but we\u2019re out of time.Fey: \u201cEmily in Paris\u201d is nominated for best TV series, musical or comedy, and I, for one, can\u2019t wait to find out which it is. \u201cFrench Exit\u201d is what I did after watching the first episode of \u201cEmily in Paris.\u201d\n\nPoehler: Maria Bakalova from \u201cBorat\u201d is a nominee tonight, which is huge for the Bulgarian community. Jim Parsons and Kaley Cuoco are nominees tonight, which is huge for the bazinga community.Fey: What else? Oh, Sia\u2019s controversial film \u201cMusic\u201d is nominated for best international flopperooni. I don\u2019t want to get into it, guys, but it\u2019s real problematic. And Twitter is saying it\u2019s the most offensive casting since Kate Hudson was the Weight Watchers spokesperson.Poehler: Oh wait, you know, this is probably something we should have told you guys earlier. Everybody is understandably upset at the H.F.P.A. and their choices. Look, a lot of flashy garbage got nominated, but that happens, OK? That\u2019s like their thing. But a number of Black actors and Black-led projects were overlooked.Fey: Look, we all know that award shows are stupid.Poehler: They are all a scam, invented by Big Red Carpet.Fey: To sell more carpet.Poehler: We know that.Fey: The point is, even with stupid things, inclusivity is important. And there are no Black members of the Hollywood Foreign Press. I realize, H.F.P.A., maybe you guys didn\u2019t get the memo because your workplace is the back booth of a French McDonald\u2019s, but you got to change that. So here\u2019s to changing it.Poehler: Yes, and looking forward to that change. We do have some good news: We are raising money tonight, donating $2 million to Feeding America\u2019s Covid-19 response fund, and that is awesome.Fey: Here we go, guys. Are you ready? Could this whole night have been an email? Yes.

Like many in the tournament\u2019s field, Morikawa, who won last year\u2019s P.G.A. Championship in August, grew up idolizing Woods. Standing next to the 18th green Sunday evening, Morikawa said of Woods, who remained hospitalized after a car crash in Los Angeles County, Calif., on Tuesday, \u201cTiger means everything to me.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI don\u2019t think we say thank you enough, so I want to say thank you to Tiger because sometimes you lose people too early.\u201d\n\nMorikawa mentioned Kobe Bryant and his paternal grandfather, Toshio, who he said died a month ago.\u201cYou don\u2019t get to say thank you enough,\u201d Morikawa said.The third-round leader, Morikawa turned in a Woods-like performance on Sunday, holding off the strongest tour field so far this year. It was Morikawa\u2019s fourth PGA Tour victory, a stunning turnaround from his first, inglorious moment in the tour spotlight only eight months ago.At the Charles Schwab Classic in June, which was the first tournament last year after the men\u2019s tour\u2019s 90-day layoff because of the pandemic, Morikawa missed a three-foot putt that ended a two-man playoff that he lost. Just three events later, he won his first pro tournament, then added the P.G.A. Championship. Morikawa has ascended to sixth in the world rankings with a string of steady performances.Going through the crucible of successfully defending his third-round lead at the Concession Golf Club could be a springboard to more victories.\n\n\u201cIt makes me a little more comfortable after sleeping on the lead knowing that guys were ready to go low today,\u201d Morikawa said. \u201cI do feel confident.\u201dMorikawa did not wear a red shirt in the final round, although his clothing manufacturer shipped him one. He said weather might have delayed the arrival.Morikawa was pursued on Sunday by two other young hotshots, Viktor Hovland, 23, and Scottie Scheffler, 24. He also had to fend off Brooks Koepka, a four-time major winner. Hovland made eight birdies to pressure Morikawa, who entered the final round with a two-stroke lead, but he faltered with bogeys on the 14th and 16th holes and finished in a three-way tie for second. Scheffler also had eight birdies, but a double bogey on the par-4 16th hole was his undoing and dropped him to fifth place. Koepka had an up-and-down round with five birdies and three bogeys, which stalled his charge, although he managed to tie Hovland and Billy Horschel for second.On Saturday, after Morikawa three-putted the 13th hole to make bogey, he called the outcome \u201cstupidity at its finest.\u201d He three-putted the 13th hole again on Sunday, but this time it led to a par, which was all he needed at the time to hold on to his three-stroke lead.\u201cI said that yesterday because I psyched myself out before I even played the 13th hole,\u201d Morikawa said of his \u201cstupidity\u201d remark. \u201cBut I learned from yesterday.\u201d\n\nMorikawa\u2019s victory was powered by consistent putting, which proved to be another turnaround for him. He ranked last in putting at his last tournament, the Genesis Invitational. He recently consulted a two-time major winner, Mark O\u2019Meara, about a new putting grip called the saw. He switched to the grip, and while the immediate results were not encouraging, he was undaunted.\n\nWith typical confidence that things would turn around, Morikawa said: \u201cI needed a full reset and I needed to figure out what was going to be a solution. And now it just feels awesome. I\u2019m very excited with how I\u2019m putting.\u201dAlthough most would consider Morikawa precocious \u2014 he turned 24 on Feb. 6 \u2014 he said on Sunday that he believed he had grown complacent after winning the P.G.A. Championship. In that way, the PGA Tour may be only beginning to see the best of him.\u201cI was getting lazy,\u201d he said. After missing the cut in several events last year, including the United States Open in September, Morikawa rededicated himself over the 2020-21 winter.\u201cBy the time this year started, my game felt really, really good \u2014 I felt some things had turned around,\u201d Morikawa said.", "Author": "Bill Pennington", "article_body_bow": [[0, 0.1813573235], [1, 0.1254089863], [5, 0.1254089863], [7, 0.1032575344], [8, 0.2838665404], [9, 0.0488596622], [10, 0.0869484134], [11, 0.0800433764], [13, 0.0988048419], [14, 0.244298311], [16, 0.34007125], [19, 0.2401301293], [22, 0.06801425], [24, 0.0946221801], [27, 0.0869484134], [28, 0.0869484134], [37, 0.1976096837], [38, 0.0869484134], [40, 0.2065150688], [41, 0.0906786617], [44, 0.0869484134], [45, 0.06801425], [46, 0.6623552609], [48, 0.0906786617]]}, {"Source": "The New York Times", "Date": "2021-03-01", "Title": "Emma Corrin, as Princess Diana, wins her first Golden Globe for \u2018The Crown.\u2019", "Article": "Emma Corrin\u2019s uncanny and sympathetic portrayal of Princess Diana on Season 4 of Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Crown\u201d \u2014 aptly nicknamed \u201cThe Diana Season\u201d \u2014 earned her a Golden Globe for best performance by an actress in a television series, drama.

Here\u2019s the sign-up.)Good morning.We\u2019re covering protests in Spain, Britain\u2019s rift with the E.U. and the latest blow to hopes for democracy in Hong Kong. \nProtests roil Spain as youths reel from pandemicFor more than a week, the streets of Barcelona, Madrid and other Spanish hubs have erupted in sometimes violent demonstrations. What began as a protest over the arrest of the Spanish rapper Pablo Has\u00e9l has become a collective outcry by a generation that has struggled through years of economic hardship and that sees a lost future even after the pandemic ends.\n\nBarcelona was once one of the best and most fun places in Europe to be young. But the coronavirus crisis, which devastated tourism and shrank the national economy by 11 percent last year, has been catastrophic for Spain\u2019s young adults. Now, 40 percent of Spain\u2019s youth are unemployed, the highest rate in Europe.\u201cIt\u2019s not the same now for a person who is 60 \u2014 or a 50-year-old with life experience and everything completely organized \u2014 as it is for a person who is 18 now and has the feeling that every hour they lose to this pandemic, it\u2019s like losing their entire life,\u201d said Enric Juliana, an opinion columnist with La Vanguardia, Barcelona\u2019s leading newspaper.Here are the latest updates and maps of the pandemic.In other developments:U.S. federal drug regulators on Saturday authorized Johnson & Johnson\u2019s one-shot vaccine for emergency use, beginning the rollout of millions of doses of a third vaccine that could reach Americans this week.The Israeli government approved a measure to vaccinate tens of thousands of Palestinians, after facing fierce criticism over the small number of inoculations it had provided to those living under its occupation in places like the West Bank, where Covid-19 cases are surging.Australia, normally a secondary market for big-brand stage shows developed in New York and London, has become an unexpected pandemic pioneer: a model and a test case for the global theater industry.A growing number of countries, including India, Hungary and Israel, have announced that they will push their Olympians to the front of their vaccination lines.\n\nThe ugly divorce between Britain and BrusselsAs trade disputes pile up, Britain and the E.U. have fallen out politically and diplomatically with a speed and a bitterness that have surprised even pessimists about the relationship.\n\nTensions have flared since a new trade agreement formalized Brexit on Jan. 1. Britain refused to grant full diplomatic status to the European Union\u2019s envoy to London, while European leaders lashed out at vaccine shortages, briefly threatening to rip up the agreement governing trade with a post-Brexit Northern Ireland.In a sign of the battles to come, the Bank of England\u2019s governor, Andrew Bailey, warned last week of a \u201cserious escalation\u201d in tensions if the E.U. tried to force banks to move the clearance of euro-denominated derivatives trading from London to the continent.Analysis: \u201cThese are not purely teething problems,\u201d said Kim Darroch, Britain\u2019s former permanent representative to the E.U., citing the government\u2019s explanation for Brexit problems. \u201cThey are structural problems that arise from not being in the single market. This is what a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 looks like.\u201dContext: As always with Brexit, much of the antagonism is being driven by domestic politics, with Britain\u2019s fast vaccine rollout serving as ammunition both for the pro-Brexit cause in Britain and for anti-British sentiment within the bloc.\n\nHong Kong charges dozens under security lawThe Hong Kong authorities on Sunday charged 47 pro-democracy figures with violating the Chinese territory\u2019s harsh new national security law. The police said each person was charged with a single count of conspiracy to commit subversion. They will be arraigned today at a courthouse in the West Kowloon area and could face life in prison if convicted.\n\nThe 47 helped to organize an informal election in July to pick candidates from Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democratic political camp to run for office. In doing so, the authorities say, they violated the security law\u2019s provisions against interfering with, disrupting or undermining the functions of the Chinese or Hong Kong governments.Context: The charges are the latest escalation in the Chinese government\u2019s efforts to bring Hong Kong firmly under control, and they represent the most forceful use yet of the wide-ranging security law, which has cemented Communist Party control over the territory.If you have 6 minutes, this is worth itAfrican-American sacrifice in World War I\n\nDenied a send-off parade in New York and assigned to the French Army because their own countrymen refused to fight alongside them, the Black warriors of the segregated American armed forces were known as the \u201cHarlem Hellfighters.\u201d Above, the Meuse-Argonne American Cemetery and Memorial in France, where the bodies of some Black Americans in the 369th Infantry Regiment were interred.It took the U.S. Army more than a century to adopt the moniker as the official special designation for the regiment, a distinction just approved by the Army in September and announced this year by the New York National Guard on the eve of Black History Month.Here\u2019s what else is happeningMyanmar: The security forces in Myanmar opened fire on demonstrators in several cities on Sunday, killing at least 18 people. It was the largest single-day toll since the protests began after the Feb. 1 coup.Jamal Khashogghi: Even though the U.S. has accused Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince of ordering the killing of the dissident Saudi writer, the Biden administration is wary of causing a break with an important Arab partner. The tension surrounding the release of an intelligence assessment on Mr. Khashogghi\u2019s killing could complicate how the two countries interact going forward.\n\nTrump returns: Former President Donald Trump delivered his first public address since leaving office at the end of a conservative conference on Sunday in Florida.

Parul Sehgal, a critic and former editor at the Book Review, looked back critically at its legacy. This is an edited extract from her thoughts on why now is the right time to delve into the past.My brief, you could say, was to review the Book Review, to consider the coverage of \u201cwomen, people of color, L.G.B.T.Q. writers\u201d and changing mores in criticism. But what revelatory news could I possibly bring? The word \u201carchive\u201d derives from the ancient Greek arkheion, sometimes translated as \u201chouse of the ruler.\u201d Who wanders there with any illusions?What could those reviews contain? Some misjudgments, to be sure \u2014 masterpieces misunderstood in their time. A few preternaturally sensitive assessments. Fluorescent condescension and stereotype. Above all, the pleasant and dubious satisfactions of feeling superior to the past.\n\nAnd yet. In recent years, The Times has faced scrutiny of the racial and gender imbalance in its reviews. One survey, which looked at nearly 750 books assessed by The Times in 2011, across all genres, found that nearly 90 percent of the authors assessed were white.But what about the reviews themselves: the language, the criteria? When \u201cwomen, people of color, L.G.B.T.Q. writers\u201d were reviewed, how was their work positioned? What patterns can we trace, what consequences? And what do we do with this knowledge \u2014 how can it be made useful? When we come to know, what do we really see?That\u2019s it for this briefing.

Farrow\u2019 Episode 2 Recap: A Family Torn Apart", "Article": "At the end of Episode 1 of \u201cAllen v. Farrow,\u201d the HBO documentary series that investigates the decades-old sexual abuse accusations by Woody Allen\u2019s adopted daughter, Dylan Farrow, the family has just started to cope with the revelation that Mr. Allen and Soon-Yi Previn were involved in a secret relationship.In January 1992, Mia Farrow, Ms. Previn\u2019s mother and Mr. Allen\u2019s girlfriend, discovered nude photos of Ms. Previn, who was then in college, at Mr. Allen\u2019s apartment.The second episode examines the fallout from that discovery and Dylan Farrow\u2019s allegations that her father sexually assaulted her in August 1992, when she was 7 years old.After the first episode premiered, a spokesperson for Mr. Allen and Ms. Previn, who have been married for more than 20 years, released a statement saying the series was \u201criddled with falsehoods\u201d and suggesting that the filmmakers did not give them ample notice to respond to it. The publisher of Mr. Allen\u2019s recent memoir, \u201cApropos of Nothing,\u201d also objected to the inclusion of snippets from the audiobook, which it says were used without permission.\n\nThe filmmakers said in a statement on Wednesday that Mr. Allen and Ms. Previn were approached in December and were given two weeks to confirm their interest in an on- or off-camera interview. A representative confirmed that they had received the request but did not respond to it, the statement said.Mr. Allen has denied ever having been sexually inappropriate or abusive toward Dylan Farrow.Here is what we saw on Sunday night, in Episode 2.A fixation on a certain kind of romanceThis episode, using interviews with journalists and clips from Mr. Allen\u2019s films, explores Mr. Allen\u2019s focus on romantic relationships between older men and younger women.In addition to the films with that theme that have been produced (\u201cHusbands and Wives,\u201d \u201cSeptember\u201d), the episode considers those that did not make it to the screen and that reside in the Woody Allen archive at Princeton University. The archive contains multiple versions of film scripts and pages of ideas with notes in the margins. Richard Morgan, a freelance journalist who examined the archive for The Washington Post, said in the documentary that it reveals a \u201cfocus\u201d on \u201cvery young women.\u201dThe episode includes an interview with Christina Engelhardt, a woman who says she started a relationship with Mr. Allen when she was 17 years old and he was in his early 40s. Ms. Engelhardt, who was a model as a teenager, said she believes their relationship was the basis for \u201cManhattan,\u201d Mr. Allen\u2019s acclaimed 1979 film that centers on a romance between a high school girl and a man \u2014 played by Mr. Allen \u2014 who is older than her father.\n\nShe says in an interview with the filmmakers that her relationship with Mr. Allen, which she said lasted until she was 23, has \u201ctaken a toll\u201d on her, affecting her later relationships. She says the experience also made her a \u201csupervigilant mother.\u201d\n\nThe aftermath of the photosAfter Ms. Farrow discovers the nude Polaroids of Ms. Previn, the family is in shock. Daisy Previn, one of Ms. Farrow\u2019s daughters, recounts how she told her sister, Soon-Yi, that she should come back to the family \u2014 that their mother would forgive her \u2014 and how Soon-Yi went in another direction, to Mr. Allen.Ms. Farrow recalls a moment that she was \u201cnot proud\u201d of from around this time: She found Soon-Yi talking to someone on the phone and, assuming it was Mr. Allen, Ms. Farrow said she \u201cpounced on her,\u201d slapping Soon-Yi on the side of the face and the shoulder. (In 2014, Moses Farrow, Mia and Woody\u2019s son, told People magazine that his mother bullied the children and hit him. Moses, who has sided with his father in saying that he does not believe that Dylan was molested, has not participated in the docuseries.)Part of a taped phone conversation between Ms. Farrow and Mr. Allen from the summer of 1992 is included in the episode. Ms. Farrow says she decided to record it because she thought Mr. Allen had already taped one of their phone calls. In the conversation, Ms. Farrow and Mr. Allen argue about what they should say to the media if his relationship with Ms. Previn becomes public.Fletcher Previn, one of Ms. Farrow\u2019s older children, tells the filmmakers that during this time, his opinion of Mr. Allen shifted dramatically.\n\n\u201cHe went from a father figure to a person who is a predator that we have to keep out of the house and protect ourselves from,\u201d Mr. Previn said.Aug. 4, 1992Amid this chaos, the family went to their Connecticut country house, and despite the rift between Ms. Farrow and Mr. Allen, he had a legal right to see Dylan and Moses Farrow because he had adopted them in 1991.The episodes include a mixture of interviews and court testimony from those who were present on Aug. 4, 1992, the day that Dylan Farrow says her father assaulted her. Mia Farrow had gone to the store with Casey Pascal, a family friend whose children and babysitter were at the house that day. Sophie Berg\u00e9, a French tutor staying with the family that summer, said that Mr. Allen arrived while they were running errands.On that day, there were about 20 minutes during which Dylan Farrow could not be found, according to 1993 testimony in the custody case from Kristi Groteke, the babysitter for the Farrow children. Ms. Groteke said in court that she looked for Dylan throughout the house but could not find her.When Ms. Farrow and Ms. Pascal returned home, Ms. Farrow said, she noticed that Dylan was not wearing underpants and asked her babysitter to get a new pair.The day afterOn Aug. 5, Ms. Pascal said that she called Ms. Farrow to tell her that the Pascals\u2019 babysitter, Alison Stickland, had witnessed something that disturbed her: Dylan Farrow sitting on the couch, with Mr. Allen, on his knees, his head buried in his daughter\u2019s lap.\n\nMs. Farrow tells the filmmakers that when she asked her daughter what had happened, Dylan confirmed that Mr. Allen had put his head in her lap and that he had also taken her up to the attic and touched her \u201cprivates.\u201d Ms. Farrow says she decided to film her daughter\u2019s account because she wanted to tell Dylan\u2019s therapist, who was away for the summer.That footage, which is being shown publicly for the first time in this series, later became the subject of controversy: Some thought it was clear evidence that Dylan Farrow was telling the truth, while others saw it as evidence that Ms. Farrow had coached her daughter on what to say.In the video, Dylan Farrow says that in the attic, her father told her, \u201cDo not move, I have to do this,\u201d and that if she stayed still, they could go on a trip to Paris.Dylan Farrow, now 35 years old, says in the documentary she remembers that during the assault, she focused her attention on her brother\u2019s train set.", "Author": "Julia Jacobs", "article_body_bow": [[1, 0.2869132456], [4, 0.1130238698], [9, 0.0558910676], [10, 0.0994611799], [11, 0.1831248749], [12, 0.1434566228], [13, 0.2260477395], [14, 0.1676732029], [17, 0.452095479], [19, 0.1831248749], [22, 0.2334065899], [26, 0.1181173504], [28, 0.0994611799], [29, 0.0994611799], [33, 0.1037282492], [34, 0.5738264912], [35, 0.0747068369], [36, 0.1082392802], [39, 0.1037282492], [42, 0.1181173504], [43, 0.1181173504], [46, 0.1082392802], [48, 0.1037282492], [49, 0.1181173504]]}, {"Source": "The New York Times", "Date": "2021-03-01", "Title": "Chlo\u00e9 Zhao becomes the first Asian woman to win the Golden Globe for best director.", "Article": "Chlo\u00e9 Zhao, whose drama \u201cNomadland\u201d offered an intimate portrait of itinerant Americans, won the Golden Globe for best director on Sunday, making her the first Asian woman ever to win that prize.In taking home the award, Zhao also became the first woman to be named best director since Barbra Streisand won for \u201cYentl\u201d almost 40 years ago.

DeMille Award, given by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association during the Golden Globes for lifetime achievement in film. \u201cAnd in turbulent, crisis-torn times like these, storytelling has always been essential.\u201dIn her six decades in Hollywood, Fonda, 83, has helped tell dozens, if not hundreds, of stories. And she has been awarded many times along the way, winning two best actress Oscars (for \u201cKlute,\u201d in 1971, and \u201cComing Home,\u201d in 1978) and eight Golden Globes, her first in 1960 for \u201cTall Story.\u201d She is the 16th woman to receive the award, the association\u2019s highest honor for film professional, which has been presented since 1952.And in that time, Fonda has carved a distinct path not only as an actress, but also as a producer, documentarian and activist passionate about global peace, human rights and climate change (a cause for which she was arrested multiple times in 2019). On Sunday, she took time to address the diversity issues hanging over the awards show. \u201cThere\u2019s a story we\u2019ve been afraid to see and hear about ourselves in this industry,\u201d she said. \u201cA story about which voices we respect and elevate and which we tune out, a story about who\u2019s offered a seat at the table and who is kept out of the rooms where decisions are made.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s Fonda\u2019s acceptance speech, in its entirety:\n\nOh my gosh, thank you. Thank you, all the members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, I\u2019m so moved to receive this honor, thank you. You know \u2014 hi, Amy \u2014 we are a community of storytellers, aren\u2019t we? And in turbulent, crisis-torn times like these, storytelling has always been essential. You see, stories have a way \u2014 they can change our hearts and our minds, they can help us see each other in a new light, to have empathy. To recognize that for all our diversity, we are humans first, right? You know, I\u2019ve seen a lot of diversity in my long life, and at times I\u2019ve been challenged to understand some of the people I\u2019ve met, but inevitably, if my heart is open and I look beneath the surface, I feel kinship.That\u2019s why all of the great conduits of perception \u2014 Buddha, Mohammad, Jesus, Lao Tzu \u2014 all of them spoke to us in stories and poetry and metaphor, because the nonlinear, noncerebral forms that are art speak on a different frequency. And they generate a new energy that can jolt us open and penetrate our defenses so that we can see and hear what we may have been afraid of seeing and hearing.Just this year, \u201cNomadland\u201d helped me feel love for the wanderers among us, and \u201cMinari\u201d opened my eyes to the experience of immigrants dealing with the realities of life in a new land. And \u201cJudas and the Black Messiah,\u201d \u201cSmall Axe,\u201d \u201cU.S. vs. Billie Holiday,\u201d \u201cMa Rainey,\u201d \u201cOne Night in Miami\u201d and others have deepened my empathy for what being Black has meant. \u201cRamy\u201d helped me feel what it means to be Muslim-American. \u201cI May Destroy You\u201d has taught me to consider sexual violence in a whole new way. The documentary \u201cAll In\u201d reminds us how fragile our democracy is and inspires us to fight to preserve it, and \u201cA Life on Our Planet\u201d shows us how fragile our small blue planet is and inspires us to save it, and ourselves.Stories, they really can change people. But there\u2019s a story we\u2019ve been afraid to see and hear about ourselves in this industry, a story about which voices we respect and elevate and which we tune out, a story about who\u2019s offered a seat at the table and who is kept out of the rooms where decisions are made. So let\u2019s all of us, including all the groups that decide who gets hired and what gets made and who wins awards, let\u2019s all of us make an effort to expand that tent so that everyone rises and everyone\u2019s story has a chance to be seen and heard. I mean, doing this simply means acknowledging what\u2019s true, being in step with the emerging diversity that\u2019s happening because of all those who marched and fought in the past and those who\u2019ve picked up the baton today. After all, art has always been not just in step with history, but has led the way. So let\u2019s be leaders, OK?
